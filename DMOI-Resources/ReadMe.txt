This folder contains resources for instructors teaching a discrete math course out of Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction by Oscar Levin.  Please do not share this folder with anyone.  I will happily send it to any instructor who requests it, but it helps me keep track of who has a copy if they go through me to get it.

Here is what is included:

1. A draft of the solution manual for the 3rd edition, which contains additional solutions to many of the exercises.  

2. Copies of exams, quizzes, homework assignments, and in-class activities from the last two times I taught the course.  Also included is the syllabus for these courses and my "lecture outline" which might give you some idea of what I actually covered day to day.  These can be found in the folders "EarlyGraphTheory" and "StandardOrder".  The former was from a semester I covered graph theory first, integrating it into many of the other topics.  The latter is from a semester where I followed the order of the textbook more closely.  Note that both of these semesters used the 2nd edition of the textbook.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or have any questions.  In particular, in addition to the solution manual, my hope is to create an instructor manual that includes solutions as well as suggestions for teaching various sections, learning objectives, and the like.  Input for what would be most helpful would be appreciated.

--Oscar
