discrete-book
=============

An open textbook for Discrete Mathematics, as taught at the University of Northern Colorado.  More information about the project is available on [the book's main website](http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com).

## Compilation Instructions

To compile, compile the file "discretebook.tex" using pdfLaTeX or similar.  If you would prefer to have margins more suitable for printing and binding (specifically two-sided), compile "discretebook-print.tex"

In case you would like to grab just single chapters or exercise sets, you *should* be able to compile each of those idividually as well (thanks to the DocMute package).

## Contributing

Any and all suggestions to improve the text are welcome.  Thanks to those who have already pointed out typos/issues they have found.  If you would like to make a more substantial contribution, please contact me so we can discuss how best to proceed.

## ToDo

Over the next few months (May to August 2016) I plan to convert the project to MathBookXML as well as make other improvements.  A new edition will be available for the Fall 2016 semester.
