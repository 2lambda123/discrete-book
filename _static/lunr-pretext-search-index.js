  "body": " This book would not exist if not for Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus. It is the book I learned discrete math out of, and taught out of the semester before I began writing this text. I wanted to maintain the inquiry based feel of their book but update, expand and rearrange some of the material. Some of the best exposition and exercises here were graciously donated from this source.  Thanks to Alees Seehausen who co-taught the Discrete Mathematics course with me in 2015 and helped develop many of the Investigate! activities and other problems currently used in the text. She also offered many suggestions for improvement of the expository text, for which I am quite grateful. Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge and Richard Grassl (again) for their suggestions after using parts of this text in their classes.  While odds are that there are still errors and typos in the current book, there are many fewer thanks to the work of Michelle Morgan over the summer of 2016.  The book is now available in an interactive online format, and this is entirely thanks to the work of Rob Beezer, David Farmer, and Alex Jordan along with the rest of the participants of the pretext-support group .  Finally, a thank you to the numerous students who have pointed out typos and made suggestions over the years and a thanks in advance to those who will do so in the future.  "

  "body": " This text aims to give an introduction to select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate for first or second year undergraduate math majors, especially those who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics. The book began as a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern Colorado. This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as the bridge course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate introduction to proofs course. Most students who take the course plan to teach, although there are a handful of students who will go on to graduate school or study applied math or computer science. For these students the current text hopefully is still of interest, but the intent is not to provide a solid mathematical foundation for computer science, unlike the majority of textbooks on the subject.  Another difference between this text and most other discrete math books is that this book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem oriented or inquiry based methods. When I teach the class, I will assign sections for reading after first introducing them in class by using a mix of group work and class discussion on a few interesting problems. The text is meant to consolidate what we discover in class and serve as a reference for students as they master the concepts and techniques covered in the unit. None-the-less, every attempt has been made to make the text sufficient for self study as well, in a way that hopefully mimics an inquiry based classroom.  The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of the students I teach at UNC. The main areas of study are combinatorics, sequences, logic and proofs, and graph theory, in that order. Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences. Most discrete books put logic first as a preliminary, which certainly has its advantages. However, I wanted to discuss logic and proofs together, and found that doing both of these before anything else was overwhelming for my students given that they didn't yet have context of other problems in the subject. Also, after spending a couple weeks on proofs, we would hardly use that at all when covering combinatorics, so much of the progress we made was quickly lost. Instead, there is a short introduction section on mathematical statements, which should provide enough common language to discuss the logical content of combinatorics and sequences.  Depending on the speed of the class, it might be possible to include additional material. In past semesters I have included generating functions (after sequences) and some basic number theory (either after the logic and proofs chapter or at the very end of the course). These additional topics are covered in the last chapter.  While I (currently) believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free to skip around to what interests you. There are occasionally examples and exercises that rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum and usually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study. If you are an instructor, feel free to edit the latex or PreTeXt source to fit your needs.   Improvements to the 3rd Edition  In addition to lots of minor corrections, both to typographical and mathematical errors, this third edition includes a few major improvements, including:   More than 100 new exercises, bringing the total to 473. The selection of which exercises have solutions has also been improved, which should make the text more useful for instructors who want to assign homework from the book.    A new section in on trees in the graph theory chapter.    Substantial improvement to the exposition in chapter 0, especially the section on functions.    The interactive online version of the book has added interactivity. Currently, many of the exercises are displayed as WeBWorK problems, allowing readers to enter answers to verify they are correct.     The previous editions (2nd edition, released in August 2016, and the Fall 2015 edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use those versions due to familiarity.  My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition each spring in time for fall adoptions. These new editions will incorporate additions and corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous semesters. Thus I encourage you to send along any suggestions and comments as you have them.    Oscar Levin, Ph.D.  University of Northern Colorado, 2019  "

  "title": "How to use this book",
  "body": " How to use this book  In addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage you to interact with the mathematics.   Investigate! activities  Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very beginning of a topic) you will find activities designed to get you acquainted with the topic soon to be discussed. These are similar (sometimes identical) to group activities I give students to introduce material. You really should spend some time thinking about, or even working through, these problems before reading the section. By priming yourself to the types of issues involved in the material you are about to read, you will better understand what is to come. There are no solutions provided for these problems, but don't worry if you can't solve them or are not confident in your answers. My hope is that you will take this frustration with you while you read the proceeding section. By the time you are done with the section, things should be much clearer.    Examples  I have tried to include the correct number of examples. For those examples which include problems , full solutions are included. Before reading the solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking. Unlike some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all inclusive for problems you will see in the exercises. They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other problems. Instead, use the examples to deepen our understanding of the concepts and techniques discussed in each section. Then use this understanding to solve the exercises at the end of each section.    Exercises  You get good at math through practice. Each section concludes with a small number of exercises meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that section. At the end of each chapter, a larger collection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of chapter review ) which might bridge material of different sections in that chapter. Many exercise have a hint or solution (which in the PDF version of the text can be found by clicking on the exercise number clicking on the solution number will bring you back to the exercise). Readers are encouraged to try these exercises before looking at the help.  Both hints and solutions are intended as a way to check your work, but often what would count as a correct solution in a math class would be quite a bit more. When I teach with this book, I assign exercises that have solutions as practice and then use them, or similar problems, on quizzes and exams. There are also problems without solutions to challenge yourself (or to be assigned as homework).    Interactive Online Version  For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier. Additionally, some of the exercises are implemented as WeBWorK problems, which allow you to check your work without seeing the correct answer immediately. Additional interactivity is planned, including instructional videos for examples and additional exercises at the end of sections. These bonus features will be added on a rolling basis, so keep an eye out!  You can view the interactive version for free at or by scanning the QR code below with your smart phone.      "

  "title": "What is Discrete Mathematics?",
  "body": " What is Discrete Mathematics?   dis crete \/ dis'krët.   Adjective : Individually separate and distinct.   Synonyms : separate - detached - distinct - abstract.   Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard. What is mathematics? The study of numbers? In part, but you also study functions and lines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and . Or perhaps you want to say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems. What sort of problems? Okay, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles, . Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of discrete to it, as defined above. Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is individually separate and distinct.  In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (maybe the set of numbers in the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: is the range of since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set.  Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number of children of each person reading this. What is the range? I'm guessing it is something like . Maybe 4 is in there too. But certainly there is nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This output set is discrete because the elements are separate. The inputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual person.  One way to get a feel for the subject is to consider the types of problems you solve in discrete math. Here are a few simple examples:    Note: Throughout the text you will see Investigate! activities like this one. Answer the questions in these as best you can to give yourself a feel for what is coming next.      The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for all of his friends. As a way to kick things off, they decide that everyone should shake hands. Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands with every other person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once, how many handshakes take place?    At the warm-up event for Oscar's All Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al ate one hot dog. Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs. Not to be outdone, Carl ate five. This continued with each contestant eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant. How many hot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat? How many hot dogs were eaten all together?    After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial chamber. The room is empty except for two large chests. On each is carved a message (strangely in English):   If this chest is empty, then the other chest's message is true.  This chest is filled with treasure or the other chest contains deadly scorpions.    You know exactly one of these messages is true. What should you do?    Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns. While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each other (as stop signs had not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed. Is it possible for each of these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections?      One reason it is difficult to define discrete math is that it is a very broad description which encapsulates a large number of subjects. In this course we will study four main topics: combinatorics (the theory of ways things combine ; in particular, how to count these ways), sequences , symbolic logic , and graph theory . However, there are other topics that belong under the discrete umbrella, including computer science, abstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some of these, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants).  Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to do it. Let's get started! Before we can begin answering more complicated (and fun) problems, we must lay down some foundation. We start by reviewing mathematical statements, sets, and functions in the framework of discrete mathematics.  "

  "body": " Mathematical Statements    knights and knaves  puzzle knights and knaves  While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a knight , who always tells the truth, or a knave , who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:   Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.  Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.  Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.   Which troll is which? self reference reference, self  reference, self self reference    In order to do mathematics, we must be able to talk and write about mathematics. Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems. As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.  Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects, and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks: mathematical statements .    Atomic and Molecular Statements   statement  atomic statement  molecular statement A statement is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called molecular .    These are statements (in fact, atomic statements):   Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.    The moon is made of cheese.    42 is a perfect square.    Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.        And these are not statements:   Would you like some cake?    The sum of two squares.   .   Go to your room!             sentence (compared to statement) The reason the sentence is not a statement is that it contains a variable. Depending on what is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the sentence into a statement is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, where , which is a true statement. Or you could capture the free variable by quantifying over it, as in, for all values of , , which is false. We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.   connectives  logical connectives You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using logical connectives . For example, this is a molecular statement:   Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.    binary connective  unary connective Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are connected by an and. We will consider 5 connectives: and (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), or (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), if , then (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), if and only if (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and not (Sam is not a man). The first four are called binary connectives (because they connect two statements) while not is an example of a unary connective (since it applies to a single statement).   truth value  propositional variable  variable, propositional  sentential variable propositional variable  Boolean variable propositional variable These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which truth value the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider propositional variables (sometimes called sentential variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: . We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two values the variables can achieve: true or false. In computer programming, we should call such variables Boolean variables .   propositional (sentential) variables  We also have symbols for the logical connectives: , , , , .   Logical Connectives  logical connectives  connectives     is read and , and called a conjunction . conjunction  and (logical connective)    logical and (conjunction)     disjunction  or (logical connective)  is read or , and called a disjunction .   logical or (disjunction)     is read if then , and called an implication or conditional . implication  conditional  implies (logical connective)  if , then (logical connective)    is read if and only if , and called a biconditional . biconditional  if and only if (logical connective)  iff if and only if    is read not , and called a negation . negation  not (logical connective)    logical negation        truth value The truth value of a statement is determined by the truth value(s) of its part(s), depending on the connectives:   Truth Conditions for Connectives  truth condition     is true when both and are true.  and (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for and    is true when or or both are true.  or (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for or    is true when is false or is true or both.  implies (logical connective)  truth condition for    if , then (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for if , then    is true when and are both true, or both false.  if and only if (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for if and only if   is true when is false. not (logical connective) truth condition for  truth condition for not       or (logical connective) inclusive vs exclusive  inclusive or  exclusive or Note that for us, or is the inclusive or (and not the sometimes used exclusive or ) meaning that is in fact true when both and are true. As for the other connectives, and behaves as you would expect, as does negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are equivalent in that they have the same truth value. This leaves only the conditional which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and as such, they deserve their own subsection.    Implications   Implications  implication  conditional  antecedent hypothesis  consequent conclusion  hypothesis  conclusion  An implication or conditional is a molecular statement of the form where and are statements. We say that   is the hypothesis (or antecedent ).   is the conclusion (or consequent ).    An implication is true provided is false or is true (or both), and false otherwise. In particular, the only way for to be false is for to be true and  to be false.    Pythagorean theorem Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the Pythagorean Theorem . Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as . This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables? So ??? How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as and are the legs of a right triangle and is the hypotenuse. In other words:    If  and are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse , then  .   This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion ( then part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis ( if part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false. However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem, it is also the case that if  , then  and are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse . So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional: and are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse  if and only if  .   Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.    Consider the statement:   If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.   This is definitely an implication: is the statement Bob gets a 90 on the final, and is the statement Bob will pass the class.   Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, was false, and the statement was true. In the first case, was true, and so was . So is true when either is false or is true.    Just to be clear, although we sometimes read as   implies   , we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements and . In particular, if you claim that is false , you are not saying that does not imply , but rather that is true and is false.    Decide which of the following statements are true and which are false. Briefly explain.   If , then most horses have 4 legs.    If , then .    If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of is an 8.    If the 7624th digit of is an 8, then .       All four of the statements are true. Remember, the only way for an implication to be false is for the if part to be true and the then part to be false.   Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, so the implication is true. It does not matter that there is no meaningful connection between the true mathematical fact and the fact about horses.    Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the implication is true.    I have no idea what the 7624th digit of is, but this does not matter. Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is automatically true.    Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis, the conclusion is true, making the implication true.       It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to prove that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.   Direct Proofs of Implications  implication direct proof for  direct proof for implication  To prove an implication , it is enough to assume , and from it, deduce .   Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form directly, you must explain why is true, but you get to assume is true first. After all, you only care about whether is true in the case that is as well.  There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most elegant style of proof and has the advantage that such a proof often does a great job of explaining why the statement is true.    Prove: If two numbers and are even, then their sum is even.     Suppose the numbers and are even. This means that and for some integers and . The sum is then . Since is an integer, this means that is even.   Notice that since we get to assume the hypothesis of the implication, we immediately have a place to start. The proof proceeds essentially by repeatedly asking and answering, what does that mean? Eventually, we conclude that it means the conclusion.    This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever found yourself starting an argument with hypothetically, let's assume , then you have attempted a direct proof of your desired conclusion.  An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements. It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements. Here we introduce some common language to address this question.   Converse and Contrapositive     The converse  converse of an implication is the implication . The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication is true is independent of the truth of the implication.    The contrapositive  contrapositive of an implication is the statement . An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).      Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.  However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if , then the triangle with sides , , and is a right triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.  The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.    True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit. Is the converse true?    True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you don't have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).  The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).    Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications and their truth values:    Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93% on her final, then she will get an A in the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:     Sue gets a 93% on her final.    Sue gets an A in the class.    Sue does not get a 93% on her final.    Sue does not get an A in the class.       Note first that whenever and are both true statements, must be true as well. For this problem, take to mean Sue gets a 93% on her final and to mean Sue will get an A in the class.      We have and , so follows. Sue gets an A.    You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an , then she gets a 93% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.    The contrapositive of the converse of is , which states that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final, then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.    What would happen if Sue does not get an A but did get a 93% on the final? Then would be true and would be false. This makes the implication false! It must be that Sue did not get a 93% on the final. Notice now we have the implication which is the contrapositive of . Since is assumed to be true, we know is true as well.       As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse, but it is possible that both the implication and its converse are true. In this case, when both and are true, we say that and are equivalent and write . This is the biconditional we mentioned earlier.   If and only if  if and only if (logical connective)  biconditional    is logically equivalent to .   Example: Given an integer , it is true that is even if and only if is even. That is, if is even, then is even, as well as the converse: if is even, then is even.   You can think of if and only if statements as having two parts: an implication and its converse. We might say one is the if part, and the other is the only if part. We also sometimes say that if and only if statements have two directions: a forward direction and a backwards direction ( , which is really just sloppy notation for ).  Let's think a little about which part is which. Is the if part or the only if part? Consider an example.    Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower. We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower, and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing. Let be the statement, I sing, and be, I'm in the shower. So is the statement if I sing, then I'm in the shower. Which part of the if and only if statement is this?  What we are really asking for is the meaning of I sing if I'm in the shower and I sing only if I'm in the shower. When is the first one (the if part) false ? When I am in the shower but not singing. That is the same condition on being false as the statement if I'm in the shower, then I sing. So the if part is . On the other hand, to say, I sing only if I'm in the shower is equivalent to saying if I sing, then I'm in the shower, so the only if part is .    It is not terribly important to know which part is the if or only if part, but this does illustrate something very, very important: there are many ways to state an implication!     Rephrase the implication, if I dream, then I am asleep in as many different ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.    The following are all equivalent to the original implication:   I am asleep if I dream.    I dream only if I am asleep.    In order to dream, I must be asleep.    To dream, it is necessary that I am asleep.    To be asleep, it is sufficient to dream.    I am not dreaming unless I am asleep.   The following are equivalent to the converse (if I am asleep, then I dream):   I dream if I am asleep.    I am asleep only if I dream.    It is necessary that I dream in order to be asleep.    It is sufficient that I be asleep in order to dream.    If I don't dream, then I'm not asleep.       Hopefully you agree with the above example. We include the necessary and sufficient versions because those are common when discussing mathematics. In fact, let's agree once and for all what they mean.   Necessary and Sufficient  necessary condition  sufficient condition      is necessary for  means .    is sufficient for  means .   If is necessary and sufficient for , then .      To be honest, I have trouble with these if I'm not very careful. I find it helps to keep a standard example for reference.    Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point , then it is continuous at , but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example, at the point 0). Restate this fact using necessary and sufficient language.    It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable at a point , it is necessary for the function to be continuous at . However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at for it to be continuous at .  It is true that to be continuous at a point , it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at . However, it is not the case that being continuous at is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at .    Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts would be enough (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true.    Predicates and Quantifiers    Consider the statements below. Decide whether any are equivalent to each other, or whether any imply any others.     You can fool some people all of the time.    You can fool everyone some of the time.    You can always fool some people.    Sometimes you can fool everyone.       free variable  predicate It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences. For example, suppose we wanted to claim that if is prime, then is not prime. This looks like an implication. I would like to write something like where means  is prime. But this is not quite right. For one thing, because this sentence has a free variable (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about), it is not a statement. A sentence that contains variables is called a predicate .  Now, if we plug in a specific value for , we do get a statement. In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for , we get a true implication in this case. What we really want to say is that for all values of , if is prime, then is not. We need to quantify the variable.  Although there are many types of quantifiers in English (e.g., many, few, most, etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two: existential and universal.   Universal and Existential Quantifiers  quantifier  The existential quantifier is and is read there exists or there is. For example, existential quantifier  quantifier there exists  there exists (quantifier)    existential quantifier   asserts that there is a number less than 0.  The universal quantifier is and is read for all or every. For example, universal quantifier  quantifier for all  for all (quantifier)    universal quantifier   asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.   As with all mathematical statements, we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false. Consider the statement . You would read this, for every there is some such that is less than . Is this true? The answer depends on what our domain of discourse is: when we say for all  , do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set? Usually this information is implied. In discrete mathematics, we almost always quantify over the natural numbers , 0, 1, 2, , so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.  For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let be ? But here is the problem: what if ? Then and that is not a number! (in our domain of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers. In symbols, .  To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the negation was true. Notice how the negation and original statement compare. This is typical.   Quantifiers and Negation  quantifier interaction with negation  negation interaction with quantifiers    is equivalent to .   is equivalent to .    Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but that causes the quantifier to switch type. This should not be surprising: if not everything has a property, then something doesn't have that property. And if there is not something with a property, then everything doesn't have that property.   Implicit Quantifiers  implicit quantifier  quantifier implicit  It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics. Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention. An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.  For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle? But how can that be true if it is not a statement? To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: standing for is a square and standing for is a rectangle . The sentence we are looking at is, . This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement. But come on! We all know that we meant to consider the statement, , and this is what our convention tells us to consider.  Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement. For example, we might write, let be the statement , is prime, which is technically incorrect. It is implicit that we mean that we are defining to be a predicate, which for each becomes the statement, is prime.      Exercises     For each sentence below, decide whether it is an atomic statement, a molecular statement, or not a statement at all.   Customers must wear shoes.   ?    atomic statement    molecular statement    not a statement      The customers wore shoes.   ?    atomic statement    molecular statement    not a statement      The customers wore shoes and they wore socks.   ?    atomic statement    molecular statement    not a statement                        This is not a statement. It is an imperative sentence, but is not either true or false. It doesn t matter that this might actually be the rule or not. Note that The rule is that all customers must wear shoes  is a statement.    This is a statement, as it is either true or false. It is an atomic statement because it cannot be divided into smaller statements.    This is again a statement, but this time it is molecular. In fact, it is a conjunction, as we can write it as The customers wore shoes and the customers wore socks.          Classify each of the sentences below as an atomic statement, a molecular statement, or not a statement at all. If the statement is molecular, say what kind it is (conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, negation).  The sum of the first 100 odd positive integers.  Everybody needs somebody sometime.  The Broncos will win the Super Bowl or I'll eat my hat.  We can have donuts for dinner, but only if it rains.  Every natural number greater than 1 is either prime or composite.  This sentence is false.      Suppose and are the statements: : Jack passed math. : Jill passed math.   Translate Jack and Jill both passed math into symbols.    Translate If Jack passed math, then Jill did not into symbols.    Translate into English.    Translate into English.    Suppose you know that if Jack passed math, then so did Jill. What can you conclude if you know that:  Jill passed math?  Jill did not pass math?          .  .   Jack passed math or Jill passed math (or both).    If Jack and Jill did not both pass math, then Jill did.      Nothing else.  Jack did not pass math either.          Determine whether each molecular statement below is true or false, or whether it is impossible to determine. Assume you do not know what my favorite number is (but you do know that 13 is prime).   If 13 is prime, then 13 is my favorite number.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      If 13 is my favorite number, then 13 is prime.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      If 13 is not prime, then 13 is my favorite number.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      13 is my favorite number or 13 is prime.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      13 is my favorite number and 13 is prime.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      7 is my favorite number and 13 is not prime.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      13 is my favorite number or 13 is not my favorite number.   ?    True    False    Not enough information                                            It is impossible to tell. The hypothesis of the implication is true. Thus the implication will be true if the conclusion is true (if 13 is my favorite number) and false otherwise.    This is true, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not. Any implication with a true conclusion is true.    This is true, again, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not. Any implication with a false hypothesis is true.    For a disjunction to be true, we just need one or the other (or both) of the parts to be true. Thus this is a true statement.    We cannot tell. The statement would be true if 13 is my favorite number, and false if not (since a conjunction needs both parts to be true to be true).    This is definitely false. 13 is prime, so its negation (13 is not prime) is false. At least one part of the conjunction is false, so the whole statement is false.    This is true. Either 13 is my favorite number or it is not, but whichever it is, at least one part of the disjunction is true, so the whole statement is true.           In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon. One is a square, and the other is a triangle. Each shape is drawn in a single color. Suppose you believe me when I tell you that if the square is blue, then the triangle is green . What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?   The square and the triangle are both blue.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      The square and the triangle are both green.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      If the triangle is not green, then the square is not blue.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      If the triangle is green, then the square is blue.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      The square is not blue or the triangle is green.   ?    True    False    Not enough information                                The main thing to realize is that we don t know the colors of these two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a blue square and green triangle. We could have a square that was not blue but a green triangle. Or we could have a square that was not blue and a triangle that was not green. The case in which the square is blue but the triangle is not green cannot occur, as that would make the statement false.   This must be false. In fact, this is the negation of the original implication.    This might be true or might be false.    True. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to it.    We do not know. This is the converse of the original statement. In particular, if the square is not blue but the triangle is green, then the original statement is true but the converse is false.    True. This is logically equivalent to the original statement.           Again, suppose the statement if the square is blue, then the triangle is green is true. This time however, assume the converse is false. Classify each statement below as true or false (if possible).   The square is blue if and only if the triangle is green.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      The square is blue if and only if the triangle is not green.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      The square is blue.   ?    True    False    Not enough information      The triangle is green.   ?    True    False    Not enough information                           The only way for an implication to be true but its converse to be false is for to be true and to be false. Thus:   False.    True.    False.    True.           Consider the statement, If you will give me a cow, then I will give you magic beans. Decide whether each statement below is the converse, the contrapositive, or neither.   If you will give me a cow, then I will not give you magic beans.   ?    Converse    Contrapositive    Neither      If I will not give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow.   ?    Converse    Contrapositive    Neither      If I will give you magic beans, then you will give me a cow.   ?    Converse    Contrapositive    Neither      If you will not give me a cow, then I will not give you magic beans.   ?    Converse    Contrapositive    Neither      You will give me a cow and I will not give you magic beans.   ?    Converse    Contrapositive    Neither      If I will give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow.   ?    Converse    Contrapositive    Neither                                     The converse is If I will give you magic beans, then you will give me a cow. The contrapositive is If I will not give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow. All the other statements are neither the converse nor contrapositive. The statement If you will not give me a cow, then I will not give you magic beans is inverse of the original statement: the contrapositive of the converse. So while it is logically equivalent to the converse, it is not the converse.        Consider the statement If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk.    Write the converse of the statement.    Write the contrapositive of the statement.    Is it possible for the contrapositive to be false? If it was, what would that tell you?    Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar drinks milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain.    Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar does not drink milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain.        You have discovered an old paper on graph theory that discusses the viscosity of a graph (which for all you know, is something completely made up by the author). A theorem in the paper claims that if a graph satisfies condition (V) , then the graph is viscous . Which of the following are equivalent ways of stating this claim? Which are equivalent to the converse of the claim?   A graph is viscous only if it satisfies condition (V).   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      A graph is viscous if it satisfies condition (V).   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      For a graph to be viscous, it is necessary that it satisfies condition (V).   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      For a graph to be viscous, it is sufficient for it to satisfy condition (V).   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      Satisfying condition (V) is a sufficient condition for a graph to be viscous.   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      Satisfying condition (V) is a necessary condition for a graph to be viscous.   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      Every viscous graph satisfies condition (V).   ?    Original    Converse    Neither      Only viscous graphs satisfy condition (V).   ?    Original    Converse    Neither                                                 Equivalent to the converse.    Equivalent to the original theorem.    Equivalent to the converse.    Equivalent to the original theorem.    Equivalent to the original theorem.    Equivalent to the converse.    Equivalent to the converse.    Equivalent to the original theorem.          Write each of the following statements in the form, if , then . Careful, some of the statements might be false (which is alright for the purposes of this question).   To lose weight, you must exercise.    To lose weight, all you need to do is exercise.    Every American is patriotic.    You are patriotic only if you are American.    The set of rational numbers is a subset of the real numbers.    A number is prime if it is not even.    Either the Broncos will win the Super Bowl, or they won't play in the Super Bowl.         If you have lost weight, then you exercised.    If you exercise, then you will lose weight.    If you are American, then you are patriotic.    If you are patriotic, then you are American.    If a number is rational, then it is real.    If a number is not even, then it is prime. (Or the contrapositive: if a number is not prime, then it is even.)    If the Broncos don't win the Super Bowl, then they didn't play in the Super Bowl. Alternatively, if the Broncos play in the Super Bowl, then they will win the Super Bowl.       Which of the following statements are equivalent to the implication, if you win the lottery, then you will be rich, and which are equivalent to the converse of the implication?   Either you win the lottery or else you are not rich.    Either you don't win the lottery or else you are rich.    You will win the lottery and be rich.    You will be rich if you win the lottery.    You will win the lottery if you are rich.    It is necessary for you to win the lottery to be rich.    It is sufficient to win the lottery to be rich.    You will be rich only if you win the lottery.    Unless you win the lottery, you won't be rich.    If you are rich, you must have won the lottery.    If you are not rich, then you did not win the lottery.    You will win the lottery if and only if you are rich.         Let be the predicate, is even.    Is true or false?   ?    True    False    Neither (not a statement)      What, if anything, can you conclude about from the truth value of    What, if anything, can you conclude about from the truth value of          is the statement is even , which is true. Thus the statement is true (for example, 5 is such an ). However, we cannot tell anything about since we do not know the truth value of for all elements of the domain of discourse. In this case, happens to be false (since is false, for example).         Let be the predicate, is even.    Is true or false?   ?    True    False    Not enough information      What, if anything, can you conclude about from the truth value of    What, if anything, can you conclude about from the truth value of                For a given predicate you might believe that the statements or are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case? You have four choices: you could give an example of an element in the domain for which is true or for which if false, or you could argue that no matter what is, is true or is false.   What would you need to do to prove is true?    What would you need to do to prove is false?    What would you need to do to prove is true?    What would you need to do to prove is false?       The claim that means that is true no matter what you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that is true is to check or otherwise argue that is true for all in the domain.    To prove is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which is false. This is often called a counterexample.    We are simply claiming that there is some element in the domain of discourse for which is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim.    Here we are claiming that no element we find will make true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that every element of the domain makes false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that is true.         binary predicate predicate binary  Suppose is some binary predicate defined on a very small domain of discourse: just the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each of the 16 pairs of these numbers, is either true or false, according to the following table ( values are rows, values are columns).      1  2  3  4    1  T  F  F  F    2  F  T  T  F    3  T  T  T  T    4  F  F  F  F     For example, is false, as indicated by the F in the first row, third column.    Use the table to decide whether the following statements are true or false.      ?    True    False    Not enough information         ?    True    False    Not enough information         ?    True    False    Not enough information         ?    True    False    Not enough information                             is false because when there is no which makes true.    is true. No matter what is (i.e., no matter what column we are in) there is some for which is true. In fact, we can always take to be    is true. In particular is such a number, so that no matter what is, is true.    is false. In fact, no matter what (column) we look at, there is always some (row) which makes false.           Translate into symbols. Use for is even and for is odd.    No number is both even and odd.    One more than any even number is an odd number.    There is prime number that is even.    Between any two numbers there is a third number.    There is no number between a number and one more than that number.        .  .   (where means is prime ).   .  .      Translate into English:  .  .  .  .        Any even number plus 2 is an even number.    For any there is a such that . In other words, every number is in the domain of sine.    For every there is an such that . In other words, every number is in the range of sine (which is false).    For any numbers, if the cubes of two numbers are equal, then the numbers are equal.       Suppose is some predicate for which the statement is true. Is it also the case that is true? In other words, is the statement always true? Is the converse always true? Assume the domain of discourse is non-empty.   Try an example. What if was the predicate, is prime ? What if it was if is divisible by 4, then it is even ? Of course examples are not enough to prove something in general, but that is entirely the point of this question.    For each of the statements below, give a domain of discourse for which the statement is true, and a domain for which the statement is false.  .   .   .     First figure out what each statement is saying. For part (c), you don't need to assume the domain is an infinite set.    solitary number  Consider the statement, For all natural numbers , if is prime, then is solitary. You do not need to know what solitary means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.   Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which. Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all , and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.    Write the negation of the original statement. What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false?    Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement if 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary true or false? Explain.    It turns out that 8 is solitary. Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive? Explain.    Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the set  of prime numbers and the set  of solitary numbers. Explain.         "

  "body": " Sets   The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in all of math) are sets . Much of what follows might be review, but it is very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory. Most of the notation we use below is standard, although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.  For us, a set  set will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played The Doctor on Doctor Who , Doctor Who or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is an element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word questionably (namely, all of them); we do not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set or not.    Notation  set notation for  We need some notation to make talking about sets easier. Consider, .  This is read, is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3. We use curly braces to enclose elements of a set. Some more notation: .  The symbol is read is in or is an element of.  element of a set Thus the above means that is an element of the set containing the letters , , and . Note that this is a true statement. It would also be true to say that is not in that set: .  Be warned: we write when we wish to express that one of the elements of the set is . For example, consider the set, .  This is a strange set, to be sure. It contains four elements: the number 1, the letter b, the set , and the empty set , the set containing no elements. Is in ? The answer is no. None of the four elements in are the letter , so we must conclude that . Similarly, consider the set . Even though the elements of are elements of , we cannot say that the set  is one of the elements of . Therefore . (Soon we will see that is a subset of , but this is different from being an element of .)  We have described the sets above by listing their elements. Sometimes this is hard to do, especially when there are a lot of elements in the set (perhaps infinitely many). For instance, if we want to be the set of all even natural numbers, would could write, , but this is a little imprecise. A better way would be .  Let's look at this carefully. First, there are some new symbols to digest: is the symbol usually used to denote that natural numbers , which we will take to be the set . Next, the colon, : , is read such that ; it separates the elements that are in the set from the condition that the elements in the set must satisfy. So putting this all together, we would read the set as, the set of all in the natural numbers, such that there exists some in the natural numbers for which is twice . In other words, the set of all natural numbers, that are even. Here is another way to write the same set. .  Note: Sometimes mathematicians use or for the such that symbol instead of the colon. Also, there is a fairly even split between mathematicians about whether is an element of the natural numbers, so be careful there.   set builder notation This notation is usually called set builder notation . It tells us how to build a set by telling us precisely the condition elements must meet to gain access (the condition is the logical statement after the symbol). Reading and comprehending sets written in this way takes practice. Here are some more examples:    Describe each of the following sets both in words and by listing out enough elements to see the pattern.    .  .  .  .         This is the set of all numbers which are 3 less than a natural number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number). The set could also be written as (note that 0 is a natural number, so is in this set because ).    This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a natural number. So here we just have .    This is the set of all integers integers, set of  set of integers (positive and negative whole numbers, written ). In other words, .    Here we want all numbers such that and are natural numbers. There is only one: 0. So we have the set .       There is also a subtle variation on set builder notation. While the condition is generally given after the such that , sometimes it is hidden in the first part. Here is an example.    List a few elements in the sets below and describe them in words. The set is the set of integers ; positive and negative whole numbers.                   The set of integers that pass the condition that their square is a natural number. Well, every integer, when you square it, gives you a non-negative integer, so a natural number. Thus .    Here we are looking for the set of all s where is a natural number. So this set is simply the set of perfect squares. .  Another way we could have written this set, using more strict set builder notation, would be as .       We already have a lot of notation, and there is more yet. Below is a handy chart of symbols. Some of these will be discussed in greater detail as we move forward.   Special sets      The empty set is the set which contains no elements.   the empty set   empty set      The universe set is the set of all elements.   universe set (domain of discourse)   universe set  domain of discourse universe set      The set of natural numbers.

Relationships Between Sets  set relationships between  We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: they have exactly the same elements. Thus, for example, .  (Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.) Also, since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers (how we write them doesn't matter, just what they are).  What about the sets and ? Clearly , but notice that every element of is also an element of . Because of this we say that is a subset  subset of , or in symbols or . Both symbols are read is a subset of. The difference is that sometimes we want to say that is either equal to or is a subset of , in which case we use . This is analogous to the difference between and .    Let , , and .

True. is the only element of the set , and is an element of , so every element in is an element of .       In the example above, is a subset of . You might wonder what other sets are subsets of . If you collect all these subsets of into a new set, we get a set of sets. We call the set of all subsets of the power set  power set of , and write it .    Let . Find .     is a set of sets, all of which are subsets of . So .  Notice that while , it is wrong to write since none of the elements in are numbers! On the other hand, we do have because .  What does a subset of look like? Notice that because not everything in is in . But we do have . The only element of is the set which is also an element of . We could take the collection of all subsets of and call that . Or even the power set of that set of sets of sets.    Another way to compare sets is by their size . Notice that in the example above, has 6 elements and , , and all have 3 elements. The size of a set is called the set's cardinality . cardinality We would write , , and so on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality of is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, is exactly the same set as ). There are sets with infinite cardinality, such as , the set of rational numbers (written ), the set of even natural numbers, and the set of real numbers ( ). It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.       Find the cardinality of .    Find the cardinality of .    If , what is the cardinality of ?          Since , we can conclude that the cardinality of the set is (you need to add one since 23 is included).    Here . The three elements are the number 1, the set , and the empty set.    We wrote out the elements of the power set above, and there are 8 elements (each of which is a set). So . (You might wonder if there is a relationship between and for all sets . This is a good question which we will return to in .)         Operations On Sets  set operations  operations on sets  Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then we can take the union  union of sets of the two sets. Symbolically, , read, is the union of and , means that the elements of are exactly the elements which are either an element of or an element of (or an element of both). For example, if and , then .  The other common operation on sets is intersection . intersection of sets We write, and say, is the intersection of and , when the elements in are precisely those both in and in . So if and , then .  Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what everything is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers. In this case we would say that our universe is . universe set Sometimes we denote this universe by . Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements which are not in a particular set. We say is the complement  complement of a set of , and write, when contains every element not contained in . So, if our universe is , and , then .  Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time. For example, consider .  This is the set of all elements which are both elements of and not elements of . What have we done? We've started with and removed all of the elements which were in . Another way to write this is the set difference : set difference  difference of sets  .  It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection, complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets. Don't confuse these with the symbols from the previous section (element of and subset of). is a set, while is true or false. This is the same difference as between (which is a number) and (which is false).    Let , , and . If the universe is , find:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .         since everything in is already in .   since everything in is in .   as the only element of both and is 2.   since and have no common elements.   . First we find that , then we take everything not in that set.   since the elements 1, 3, and 5 are in but not in . This is the same as .   . The set contains all elements that are either in but not in (i.e., ), or not in both and (i.e., ).   since nothing is added by the empty set.   since nothing can be both in a set and in the empty set.      Having notation like this is useful. We will often want to add or remove elements from sets, and our notation allows us to do so precisely.    If , then we can describe the set we get by adding the number 4 as . If we want to express the set we get by removing the number 2 from we can do so by writing .  Careful though. If you add an element to the set, you get a new set! So you would have and then correctly say that contains 4, but does not.    You might notice that the symbols for union and intersection slightly resemble the logic symbols for or and and. This is no accident. What does it mean for to be an element of ? It means that is an element of  or  is an element of (or both). That is, .  Similarly, .  Also, . which says is an element of the complement of if is not an element of .  There is one more way to combine sets which will be useful for us: the Cartesian product , Cartesian product  .   the Cartesian product of and  This sounds fancy but is nothing you haven't seen before. When you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in the Cartesian plane. This is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers . We can do this for any pair of sets, not just the real numbers with themselves.  Put another way, . The first coordinate comes from the first set and the second coordinate comes from the second set. Sometimes we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with itself, and this is fine: (we might also write for this set). Notice that in , we still want all ordered pairs, not just the ones where the first and second coordinate are the same. We can also take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or quadruples, and so on.    Let and . Find and . How many elements do you expect to be in ?     .   .   . There will be 3 pairs with first coordinate , three more with first coordinate , and a final three with first coordinate .      Venn Diagrams  Venn diagram  set Venn diagram   Venn diagram There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets. A Venn diagram displays sets as intersecting circles. We can shade the region we are talking about when we carry out an operation. We can also represent cardinality of a particular set by putting the number in the corresponding region.      Two overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangular box. Circles labeled A and B.       Three overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangle. The circle labeled A is in the top left, the circle labeled B is in the top right, the circle labeled C is in the bottom center. The circles intersect to create seven interior regions: one inside all circles, three inside just a pair of circles, and three inside only one circle.     Each circle represents a set. The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe. To represent combinations of these sets, we shade the corresponding region. For example, we could draw as: Venn diagram intersection      Two overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangular box. Circles labeled A and B. The overlapping region inside both circles is shaded light gray.    Here is a representation of , or equivalently :  Venn diagram  set difference       Two overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangular box. Circles labeled A and B. The region inside circle A but outside circle B is shaded light gray.    A more complicated example is , as seen below.     Three overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangle. The circle labeled A is in the top left, the circle labeled B is in the top right, the circle labeled C is in the bottom center. The circles intersect to create seven interior regions: one inside all circles, three inside just a pair of circles, and three inside only one circle. Three of the seven regions are shaded light gray: the region in C alone, the region in just C and B, and the center region in all three circles.    Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of , then excluded the region where and overlap outside of . That region is . So the above Venn diagram also represents . So using just the picture, we have determined that .      Interactive Exercises     Find the least element of each of the following sets, if there is one.  If there is no least element, enter none .     .                                       This is the set since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least 3 more than 3. Since but we see that the first such natural number is 3.    We get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which is a natural number is 3.  Note that if we didn t specify by saying that then any integer less than would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.    This is the set namely the set of numbers that are the result of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number. (   and so on.) Thus the least element of the set is 1.    Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 1. That is, the same set as the previous part. So again, the least element is 1.          "

  "body": " Functions    function  domain  codomain  image of an element A function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. We call the output the image of the input. The set of all inputs for a function is called the domain . The set of all allowable outputs is called the codomain . We would write to describe a function with name , domain and codomain . This does not tell us which function is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).  For example, consider the function defined by . Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers). The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the codomain). Notice though that not every natural number is actually an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers that are outputs is called the range  range of a function of the function (in this case, the range is , all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).  The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.    The following are all examples of functions:    defined by . The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.     defined by , and . The domain is the set , the codomain is the set and the range is the set . Note that and are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since each element in the domain still has only one output.     defined by the table:      1  2  3  4     3  6  9  12     Here the domain is the finite set and to codomain is the set of natural numbers, . At first you might think this function is the same as defined above. It is absolutely not. Even though the rule is the same, the domain and codomain are different, so these are two different functions.         Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would write a function, does not mean that the rule is a function. The following are NOT functions.    defined by . The reason this is not a function is because not every input has an output. Where does send 3? The rule says that , but is not an element of the codomain.    Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone number. If you think of the set of people as the domain and the set of phone numbers as the codomain, then this is not a function, since some people have two phone numbers. Switching the domain and codomain sets doesn't help either, since some phone numbers belong to multiple people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are reading this).         Describing Functions  function how to describe  It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description. The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone ever talks about it. But when we do want to talk about the function, we need a way to describe it. A particular function can be described in multiple ways.   rule of four Some calculus textbooks talk about the Rule of Four , that every function can be described in four ways: algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically, or in words. In discrete math, we can still use any of these to describe functions, but we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that have or a finite subset of as their domain.   graph (of a function) Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the function: plotting the points on the plane. We can do this, and might get a graph like the following for a function .     Graph of the first quadrant, including axes and a rectangular grid. Points on grid at (1,2), (2, 1) and (3,3).    It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.  Here is another way to represent that same function:     Two rows containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. Arrows from the top 1 to bottom 2, from the top 2 to bottom 1, and top 3 straight down to bottom 3.    This shows that the function sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just follow the arrows.  The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions with finite domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.  Note that for finite domains, finding an algebraic formula that gives the output for any input is often impossible. Of course we could use a piecewise defined function, like . This describes exactly the same function as above, but we can all agree is a ridiculous way of doing so.  Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, let's adopt some notation to describe them. All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain. In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:      0  1  2  3  4     3  3  2  4  1      two-line notation  function two-line notation We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input directly over its output: . Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).  One advantage of the two-line notation over the arrow diagrams is that it is harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using two-line notation.    Which of the following diagrams represent a function? Let and .     Picture labeled f:X to Y with two rows of numbers and letters and arrows between the rows. Top row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bottom row contains letters a, b, c, and d. Arrows point from 1 to d, 2 to a, 3 to c, and 4 to d.     Picture labeled g:X to Y with two rows of numbers and letters and arrows between the rows. Top row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bottom row contains letters a, b, c, and d. Arrows point from 1 to d, 2 to a, 3 to a, and 4 to b.     Picture labeled f:X to Y with two rows of numbers and letters and arrows between the rows. Top row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bottom row contains letters a, b, c, and d. Arrows point from 2 to a and also 2 to c, 3 to d, and 4 to b.       is a function. So is . There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as .  However, is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain ( and ). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:     Three black dots in a row above and two white dots in a row below. An arrow points from the left black dot to the left white dot and from the right black dot to the right white dot.     Three black dots in a row above and four white dots in a row below. Two arrows point from the left black dot to each of the two left-most white dots. Each of the other black dots have an arrow pointing down to the white dots below and slightly to the right of them.    It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for . We would have something like: . There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always work .    We will also be interested in functions with domain . Here two-line notation is no good, but describing the function algebraically is often possible. Even tables are a little awkward, since they do not describe the function completely. For example, consider the function given by the table below.      0  1  2  3  4  5      0  1  4  9  16  25      Have I given you enough entries for you to be able to determine ? You might guess that , but there is no way for you to know this for sure. Maybe I am being a jerk and intended . In fact, for every natural number , there is a function that agrees with the table above, but for which .  Okay, suppose I really did mean for , and in fact, for the rule that you think is governing the function to actually be the rule. Then I should say what that rule is. . Now there is no confusion possible.  Giving an explicit formula that calculates the image of any element in the domain is a great way to describe a function. We will say that these explicit rules are closed formulas for the function. closed formula for a function   There is another very useful way to describe functions whose domain is , that rely specifically on the structure of the natural numbers. We can define a function recursively !    Consider the function given by and . Find .    The rule says that (we are using so ). We don't know what is though. Well, we know that . So we need to compute , which will require knowing , which will require , will it ever end?  Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have as our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up to instead of working down from :   It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the explicitly defined function . Is it? Later we will prove that it is.    Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a real world problem, because they describe how the values of the functions are changing. However, this comes with a price. It is harder to calculate the image of a single input, since you need to know the images of other (previous) elements in the domain.   Recursively Defined Functions  recursively defined function   initial condition for a function  recurrence relation for a function For a function , a recursive definition consists of an initial condition together with a recurrence relation . The initial condition is the explicitly given value of . The recurrence relation is a formula for in terms for (and possibly itself).     Give recursive definitions for the functions described below.    gives the number of snails in your terrarium years after you built it, assuming you started with 3 snails and the number of snails doubles each year.     gives the number of push-ups you do days after you started your push-ups challenge, assuming you could do 7 push-ups on day 0 and you can do 2 more push-ups each day.     defined by . Recall that is the product of all numbers from through . We also define .          The initial condition is . To get we would double the number of snails in the terrarium the previous year, which is given by . Thus . The full recursive definition contains both of these, and would be written, .    We are told that on day 0 you can do 7 push-ups, so . The number of push-ups you can do on day is 2 more than the number you can do on day , which is given by . Thus .    Here . To get the recurrence relation, think about how you can get from . If you write out both of these as products, you see that is just like except you have one more term in the product, an extra . So we have, .         Surjections, Injections, and Bijections  surjection  injection  bijection  We now turn to investigating special properties functions might or might not possess.  In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort of the thing does not happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is onto  onto function surjection or that the function maps the domain onto the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy math term for an onto function is a surjection , surjection and we say that an onto function is a surjective function.  In pictures:     Four black dots in a top row and three white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them: the two white dots on the left have one arrow each point to them. The right-most white dot has two arrows pointing to it, coming from two different black dots. The image is labeled with the word \"Surjective\"      Four black dots in a top row and three white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them: the two white dots on the left and right have two arrows each pointing to them. The center white dot has no arrows pointing to it. The image is labeled with the words \"Not surjective\"       Which functions are surjective (i.e., onto)?  defined by .   defined by .    defined as follows:     Two rows containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. Arrows from the top 1 to bottom 2, from the top 2 to bottom 1, and top 3 straight down to bottom 3.            is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that would be sent to 1, but is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to .   is not surjective. There is no (the domain) for which , so , which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain missing from the bottom row of the matrix.   is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.      To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse is permissible: a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this does not occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is one-to-one . one-to-one function injection Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an injection . injection We call one-to-one functions injective functions.  In pictures:     Four black dots in a top row and five white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them. Each black dot has an arrow pointing to a different white dot. The center white dot has no arrow pointing to it. The image is labeled with the word \"Injective\"      Four black dots in a top row and five white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them. Two of the black dots have an arrow pointing to a different white dot. The other two black dots have arrows pointing to the same white dot. Two white dots have no arrows pointing to them. The image is labeled with the words \"Not injective\"       Which functions are injective (i.e., one-to-one)?  defined by .   defined by .    defined as follows:     Two rows containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. Arrows from the top 1 to bottom 2, from the top 2 to bottom 1, and top 3 straight down to bottom 3.            is injective. Each element in the codomain is assigned to at most one element from the domain. If is a multiple of three, then only is mapped to . If is not a multiple of 3, then there is no input corresponding to the output .   is not injective. Both inputs and are assigned the output . Notice that there is an element from the codomain that appears more than once on the bottom row of the matrix.   is injective. Each output is only an output once.      Be careful: surjective and injective are NOT opposites. You can see in the two examples above that there are functions which are surjective but not injective, injective but not surjective, both, or neither. In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection), we say the function is a bijection , bijection or that the function is a bijective function.  To illustrate the contrast between these two properties, consider a more formal definition of each, side by side.   Injective vs Surjective  A function is injective provided every element of the codomain is the image of at most one element from the domain.  A function is surjective provided every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain.   Notice both properties are determined by what happens to elements of the codomain: they could be repeated as images or they could be missed (not be images). Injective functions do not have repeats but might or might not miss elements. Surjective functions do not miss elements, but might or might not have repeats. The bijective functions are those that do not have repeats and do not miss elements.     Image and Inverse Image  image  inverse image  When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say ) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write , which is the image of ). Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain. It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say ) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image of. We could write those in the domain such that , but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.   image of a set To address the first situation, what we are after is a way to describe the set of images of elements in some subset of the domain. Suppose is a function and that is some subset of the domain (possibly all of it). We will use the notation to denote the image of under , namely the set of elements in that are the image of elements from . That is, .   the image of under .     inverse image  complete inverse image We can do this in the other direction as well. We might ask which elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain. Let be a function and suppose is a subset of the codomain. Then we will write for the inverse image of under , namely the set of elements in whose image are elements in . In other words, .   the inverse image of under .    Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element of in the codomain. The notation above works: is the set of all elements in the domain that sends to . It makes sense to think of this as a set: there might not be anything sent to (if is not in the range), in which case . Or might send multiple elements to (if is not injective). As a notational convenience, we usually drop the set braces around the and write instead for this set.   inverse image comparison to inverse function WARNING: is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but is defined for any function . The point: is a set , not an element of the domain. This is just sloppy notation for . To help make this distinction, we would call the complete inverse image of under . It is not the image of under (since the function might not exist).    Consider the function given by . Find , , and .     since and are the elements in the codomain to which sends , , and .   since these are exactly the elements that sends to and .   since is not in the range of .      Consider the function defined by . Find and . Then find , , and .    Note that . The first is an element: . The second is a set: .  To find , we need to find all integers such that . Clearly only 0 works, so (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).  To find , we need to find all such that . We see .  Finally, if , then we are looking for an such that . There are no such integers so .    Since is a set, it makes sense to ask for , the number of elements in the domain which map to .    Find a function such that .    There is only one such function. We need five elements of the domain to map to the number . Since there are only five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7. So .     Function Definitions  Here is a summary of all the main concepts and definitions we use when working with functions.    function  domain  codomain A function is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the domain , to exactly one element of a second set, called the codomain .     function notation Notation: is our way of saying that the function is called , the domain is the set , and the codomain is the set .     two-line notation  function two-line notation To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use two-line notation by writing a matrix with each output directly below its corresponding input, as in: .     image of an element  means the element of the domain (input) is assigned to the element of the codomain. We say is an output. Alternatively, we call the image of under .     range of a function The range is a subset of the codomain. It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function. That is, the range is the set of all outputs.     injection A function is injective (an injection or one-to-one ) if every element of the codomain is the image of at most one element from the domain.     surjection A function is surjective (a surjection or onto ) if every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain.     bijection A bijection is a function which is both an injection and surjection. In other words, if every element of the codomain is the image of exactly one element from the domain.     image of an element The image of an element in the domain is the element in the codomain that is mapped to. That is, the image of under is .     inverse image  complete inverse image The complete inverse image of an element in the codomain, written , is the set of all elements in the domain which are assigned to by the function.     image of a subset The image of a subset of the domain is the set .     inverse image of a subset The inverse image of a subset of the codomain is the set .

Such an is since Note that 2 is above a 1 in the notation.    has this property. We say that 4 is a fixed point of Not all functions have such a point.    Such an element is 2 (in fact, that is the only element in the codomain that is not in the range). In other words, 2 is not the image of any element under nothing is sent to 2.           The following functions all have as both their domain and codomain. For each, determine whether it is (only) injective, (only) surjective, bijective, or neither injective nor surjective.      ?

It is not injective because more than one element from the domain has 3 as its image. It is not surjective because there are elements of the codomain (1, 2, 4, and 5) that are not images of anything from the domain.    This is a bijection. Every element in the codomain is the image of exactly one element of the domain.    This is a bijection. Note that we can write this function in two line notation as    In two line notation, this function is From this we can quickly see it is neither injective (for example, 1 is the image of both 1 and 2) nor surjective (for example, 4 is not the image of anything).

Note that with the initial condition , the values of the function are: , , , , and so on, the images cycling through those three numbers. Thus is NOT injective (and also certainly not surjective). Might it be under other initial conditions? It turns out this is a really hard question to answer in general. The Collatz conjecture is that no matter what the initial condition is, the function will eventually produce 1 as an output. This is an open problem in mathematics: nobody knows the answer.

Every integer is an output (of twice itself, for example) but some integers are outputs of more than one input: .      Let . Consider the function given by .

There are two cases: First, if is even, then let . Since is even, is odd, so as desired. Second, if is odd, then let . Since is odd, is even, so as needed. Therefore is surjective.        At the end of the semester a teacher assigns letter grades to each of her students. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?   Yes, this is a function, if you choose the domain and codomain correctly. The domain will be the set of students, and the codomain will be the set of possible grades. The function is almost certainly not injective, because it is likely that two students will get the same grade. The function might be surjective it will be if there is at least one student who gets each grade.    In the game of Hearts , four players are each dealt 13 cards from a deck of 52.
