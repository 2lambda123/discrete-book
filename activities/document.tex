\begin{document}
While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls.  Each is either a {\em knight}, who always tells the truth, or a {\em knave}, who always lies.  The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave.  Each troll makes a single statement:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item[] Troll 1: If I am a knave then there are exactly two knights here. 
   \item[] Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.
   \item[] Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.
  \end{itemize}
  Which troll is which?
