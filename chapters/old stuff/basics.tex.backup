%This is basics.tex.  This chapter will have sections on reading and counting.  That means logic (basics, more to be done later) and simple combinatorics (multiplication principle, permutations, combinations, the difference).

Discrete mathematics puts a heavy emphasis on counting.  This is not surprising, as we are working with individual, {\em discrete} objects.  The first question you can ask is, ``how many of them are there?''  Counting is so important, it is given its own classification within discrete mathematics: combinatorics.  We will only scratch the surface here, but it is important to have a solid foundation in some basic counting techniques before tackling more challenging topics.  But even before we can count, we must know what we are to count, and this is expressed to use in English sentences.  Most problems in discrete mathematics are word problems.  This is a symptom of how applicable the subject is to the real world.  Of course, this also can lead to trouble: students have a notorious hatred of word problems.  Overcoming this fear is the first step, and where we will start.

\section{How to read}

Here is how to read mathematics: very carefully.  I know this sounds like a bad joke.  But there is something to this.  Many students do not realize that writing is a large part of mathematics.  Indeed, those of us who research mathematics spend most of our time writing.  As such, written mathematics has order, structure and precision beyond that of most other writing.  When we read a word problem, we should keep this in mind.  There is a very precise meaning to the words.  The first step is to find it.

Consider this often controversial example from probability.

\begin{quote}
 A man has exactly two children, and one of them is a boy born on a Tuesday.  What is the probability that the man has two sons?
\end{quote}

We will see how to solve this question when we tackle probability in chapter \ref{chProbability}.  Right now, I want to just look at the question itself.  In particular, let us think about what it means for a man to have two children, one of which is a boy born on a Tuesday.  Could it be that he has two sons?  Could it be that he has two sons both born on a Tuesday?  Could it be that he has a daughter born on Tuesday?  Technically, the answer to each of these questions is ``yes.''  You might argue that most people use ``one of them'' to mean ``exactly one of them,'' and you would be right.  But that has nothing to do with what is going on here.  In mathematics, the technical reading is the correct one.  Admittedly, it might have been clearer to write this:

\begin{quote}
 A man has exactly two children.  At least one of them is a child who is both (1) a boy and (2) born on a Tuesday.  What is the probability that the man has two sons?
\end{quote}

Of course while that is clearer, it is not as eloquent or even readable.  Being stylistically pleasing is not a mathematician's first goal, but what good is writing is nobody will read it.  

When reading a question in mathematics there are exactly two possibilities.  Either the technical, perhaps overly precise reading is correct, or the question is stated incorrectly.  This latter possibility does happen (math question are, after all, written by humans) so is worth looking out for.  The point is that it is a mistake to try to read into the meaning behind the question.  You cannot understand a word problem by reading it, getting the gist of it, and then trying to solve some problem which you think is approximately in the area of the original question.

Lest you think this is an isolated phenomenon, consider another example.

\begin{example} Consider the following word problem taken from {\em The Heart of Mathematics} by Burger and Starbird.
\begin{quote}
There are two boxes: one marked A and one marked B. Each box contains either \$1 million or a deadly snake that will kill you instantly. You must open one box. On box A there is a sign that reads: “At least one of these boxes contains \$1 million.” On box B there is a sign that reads: “A deadly snake that will kill you instantly is in box A.” You are told that either both signs are true or both are false. Which box do you open? Be careful, the wrong answer is fatal!
\end{quote}
Do not try to solve the problem.  Consider the statement ``Each box contains either \$1 million or a deadly snake.''  Which of the following {\em could} be true?
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Both boxes contain \$1 million.
\item Both boxes contain a deadly snake.
\item The first box contains both 
\end{enumerate}
