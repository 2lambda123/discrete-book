\begin{defbox}{Function Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A {\em function} is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the {\em domain}, to exactly one element of a second set, called the {\em codomain}.
  \item Notation: $f:X \to Y$ is our way of saying that the function is called $f$, the domain is the set $X$ and the codomain is the set $Y$.
  \item $f(x) = y$ means the element $x$ of the domain (input) is assigned to the element $y$ of the codomain.  We say $y$ is an output.  Alternatively, we call $y$ the {\em image of $x$ under $f$}.
  \item The {\em range} is a subset of the codomain.  It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function.  That is, the range is the set of all outputs.
  \item A function is {\em one-to-one} (also called an {\em injection}) if every element of the codomain is the output for \textbf{at most} one element from the domain.
  \item A function is {\em onto} (also called a {\em surjection}) if every element of the codomain is the output of \textbf{at least} one element of the domain.
  \item A {\em bijection} is a function which is both an injection and surjection - so one-to-one and onto.
  \item The {\em complete inverse image} of an element in the codomain, written $f\inv(y)$ is the {\bf set} of all element in the domain which are assigned to $y$ by the function.

\section{Functions}

A function is simply a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.  The set of all inputs for a function is called the {\em domain}.  The set of all allowable outputs is called the codomain.  For example, a function might assign each natural number a natural number from 1 to 5.  In that case, the domain is the natural numbers and the codomain is the set of natural numbers from 1 to 5. Now it could be that this particular function we are thinking about assigns each even natural number to the number 2 and each odd natural number to the number 1.  In this case, not all of the codomain is actually used.  We would say that the set $\{1,2\}$ is the {\em range} of the function - these are the element in the codomain (allowable outputs) which are actually outputs for some input. 

The key thing that makes a rule assigning inputs to outputs a {\em function} is that there is {\em only one} output for an input.  In other words, it is important that the rule be a good rule.  What output do we assign to the input 7?  There can only be one answer for a particular function - otherwise where does 7 go to?  

To specify the name of the function, as well as the domain and codomain, we write $f:X \to Y$.  The function is called $f$, the domain is the set $X$ and the codomain is the set $Y$.  This however does not describe the rule.  To do that, we say something like this:

\begin{quote}
  The function $f:X \to Y$ is defined by $f(x) = x^2 + 3$.
\end{quote}

In this case, the function takes an input $x$ and computes the output by squaring $x$ and then adding 3.  In this case, you better hope that $X$ is a set of numbers and $Y$ is a set of number which can be 3 more than squares of numbers from $X$.  It would not work for $Y$ to be negative numbers here - that would not be a valid function.

The description of the rule can vary greatly.  If $X$ is a finite set, we might just give a list of each output for each input.  You could also describe the function with at able or a graph or in words.

\begin{example}
  The following are all examples of functions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f:\Z \to \Z$ defined by $f(n) = 3n$.  The domain and codomain are both the set of integers.  However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.
    \item $f: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b,c\}$ defined by $f(1) = c$, $f(2) = a$ and $f(3) = a$.  The domain is the set $\{1,2,3\}$, the codomain is the set $\{a,b,c\}$ and the range is the set $\{a,c\}$.  Note that $f(2)$ and $f(3)$ are the same element of codomain.  This is not a problem - each element in the domain still has only one output (although each output does not have a unique input).
    \item $f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}$ defined as follows:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[->] (-1,1) node[above] {1} -- (0,0) node[below] {2};
        \draw[->] (0,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1,0) node[below] {1};
        \draw[->] (1,1) node[above] {3} -- (1,0) node[below] {3};
      \end{tikzpicture}

    \end{center}

  \end{enumerate}

\end{example}

The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions.  We will often be working with functions on finite sets so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.  A graph of the function in example 3 above would look like this:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    %axis:
    \draw[thin, gray!50] (0,0) grid (3.5, 3.5);
    \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0,3.5);
   \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (3.5,0);
   %points:
   \fill (1,2) circle (5pt) (2,1) circle (5pt) (3,3) circle (5pt);
  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

It is important to know how to recognize a function from a rule which is not a function.  The arrow diagram can help.

\begin{example}
Which of the following diagrams represent a function.  Let $X = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $Y = \{a,b,c,d\}$
  \begin{multicols}{3}
    \begin{center}
      $f:X \to Y$
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[->] (-1.5,1) node[above] {1} -- (1.5,0) node[below] {$d$};
        \draw[->] (-.5,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1.5,0) node[below] {$a$};
        \draw[->] (.5,1) node[above] {3} -- (.5, 0) node[below] {$c$};
        \draw[->] (1.5,1) node[above] {4} -- (-.5, 0) node[below] {$b$};
      \end{tikzpicture}
      \columnbreak
      
      $g:X \to Y$

        \draw[->] (1.5,1) node[above] {4} -- (-.5, 0) node[below] {$b$};
        \draw (.5,0) node[below] {$c$};

      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

  \end{multicols}
\begin{solution}
  $f$ is a function.  So is $g$.  There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the output for any input, and there is no problem with $a$ from the codomain being the output of both 2 and 3 from the input.  
  
  However, $h$ is {\bf not} a function - in fact, for two reasons.  First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain.  Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain ($a$ and $c$).  Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function.  Neither of these mappings are functions:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \fill (-1, 1.2) circle (.1) (0,1.2) circle (.1) (1, 1.2) circle (.1);
        \draw[->] (-1, 1) -- (-.5,0);
        \draw[->] (1,1) -- (.5, 0);
        \draw (-.5, -0.2) circle (.1) (.5, -0.2) circle (.1);

         \draw[->] (0,1) -- (.5,0);
         \draw[->] (1,1) -- (1.5, 0);

  Not functions.

\section{Surjections, Injections, and Bijections}

We now turn to investigating special properties functions might or might not possess.  

In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range - which are not actual outputs for any input.  When this sort of the thing {\em does not} happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is {\em onto} or that the function maps the domain {\em onto} the codomain.  This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top the codomain.  The fancy math term for an onto function is a {\em surjection}, and we say that an onto function is a {\em surjective} function.

In pictures:

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{center}
          \begin{tikzpicture}
        \fill (-1.5, 1.2) circle (.1) (-.5,1.2) circle (.1) (.5, 1.2) circle (.1) (1.5,1.2) circle (.1);
        \draw[->] (-1.5, 1) -- (-1,0);
        \draw[->] (-.5,1) -- (0, 0);
        \draw[->] (.5, 1) -- (.9,0);
        \draw[->] (1.5,1) -- (1.1,0);
        \draw (-1, -0.2) circle (.1) (0, -0.2) circle (.1) (1, -0.2) circle (.1);
      \end{tikzpicture}

        \fill (-1.5, 1.2) circle (.1) (-.5,1.2) circle (.1) (.5, 1.2) circle (.1) (1.5,1.2) circle (.1);
        \draw[->] (-1.5, 1) -- (-1.1,0);
        \draw[->] (-.5,1) -- (-.9, 0);
        \draw[->] (.5, 1) -- (.9,0);
        \draw[->] (1.5,1) -- (1.1,0);
        \draw (-1, -0.2) circle (.1) (0, -0.2) circle (.1) (1, -0.2) circle (.1);
      \end{tikzpicture}
      
      Not onto
  \end{center}

\end{multicols}

\begin{example}
  Which functions are surjective (i.e., onto)?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f:\Z \to \Z$ defined by $f(n) = 3n$.  
    \item $g: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b,c\}$ defined by $g(1) = c$, $g(2) = a$ and $g(3) = a$.  
    \item $h:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}$ defined as follows:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[->] (-1,1) node[above] {1} -- (0,0) node[below] {2};
        \draw[->] (0,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1,0) node[below] {1};
        \draw[->] (1,1) node[above] {3} -- (1,0) node[below] {3};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $f$ is not surjective.  There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range.  For example, no $n \in \Z$ gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that $\frac{1}{3}$ would be sent to 1, but $\frac{1}{3}$ is not in the domain).  In fact, the range of the function is $3\Z$ (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to $\Z$.
      \item $g$ is not surjective.  There is no $x \in \{1,2,3\}$ (the domain) for which $g(x) = b$.  So $b$, which is in the codomain, is not in the range, so once again the function is not onto.
      \item $h$ is surjective.  Every element of the codomain is also in the range.  Nothing is missed.
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{solution}

\end{example}


To be a function, a map cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain.  However, we have seen that the reverse is permissible.  That is, a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain.  When this {\em does not} occur - that is, when each element of the codomain is assigned to at most one element of the domain - then we say the function is {\em one-to-one}.  Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain.  One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is a {\em injection}.  We call one-to-one functions {\em injective} functions.

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $f$ is injective.  Each element in the codomain is assigned to at {\em most} one element from the domain - if $x$ is a multiple of three, then only $x/3$ is mapped to $x$.  If $x$ is not a multiple of 3, then there is no input corresponding to the output $x$.
      \item $g$ is not injective.  Both inputs $2$ and $3$ are assigned the output $a$.
      \item $h$ is injective.  Each output is only an output once.
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{solution}

\end{example}



From the examples above, it should be clear that there are functions which are surjective, injective, both or neither.  In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (a injection and surjection) we say the function is a {\em bijection}, or that the function is a {\em bijective} function.  

\subsection{Proofs}

Given a function, it would be nice to not only determine whether it is injective and/or surjective, but to prove the result.  Let's start with the easy half.

\begin{example} Prove that $f:\Z \to \Z$ defined by $f(n) = n^2$ is not surjective.
  \begin{solution}
    Note that for a function to be surjective (onto), every element in the codomain must also be in the range.  So to prove that a function is not surjective, all we need to do is to find one element in the codomain which is not in the range.
    \begin{proof}
      The integer $2$ is not in the range (although is in the codomain) since there is not integer $n$ such that $n^2 = 2$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{solution}
\end{example}

\begin{example} Prove that $f:\Z \to \Z$ defined by $f(n) = n^2$ is not injective.
  \begin{solution}
    For a function to be injective (one-to-one), every element in the codomain can be the output for at most one input from the domain.  So to prove that a function is not injective, all we need to do is to find two elements in the domain which map to the same output from the codomain.  That is, we find $x \ne y$ in the domain for which $f(x) = f(y)$.
    \begin{proof}
      Consider the integers $2$ and $-2$, both in the domain.  Clearly $2 \ne -2$ but $f(2) = 4$ and $f(-2) = 4$, so  $f(2) = f(-2)$. 
    \end{proof}
  \end{solution}
\end{example}

Proving that a function {\em is} injective or surjective is harder, but still doable.

\begin{example}
  Consider function $f: \Z \to \Z$ be given by \[f(n) = \begin{cases}
\frac{n}{2} & \mbox{ if $n$ is even}\\
3n + 1 & \mbox{ if $n$ is odd}
\end{cases}\]
Prove that $f$ is a surjection.
\begin{solution}
  Don't let the piecewise definition of the function scare you - we just change the rule slightly depending on whether $n$ is even or odd.  To prove the function is surjective, we must show that every integer (the codomain) is the output for some input.  Ideally, we will find the input which works.  
  \begin{proof}
    Let $n \in \Z$ be an arbitrary element of the codomain.  Since $n$ is an integer, so is $2n$.  Also, $2n$ is even.  Thus $f(2n) = \frac{2n}{2} = n$.  Therefore there is an element of the domain ($2n$) which is mapped to $n$ by $f$.  Since $n$ is arbitrary, we have the $f$ is surjective.
  \end{proof}

\end{solution}

\end{example}


\begin{example}
  Consider the function $f: \Z \to \Z$ given by $f(n) = 3n + 7$.  Prove that $f$ is a injection.
  \begin{solution}
    We want to say that if we take two {\em different} elements of the domain, they get mapped to two different elements of the codomain.  That is, if $x \ne y$ then $f(x) \ne f(y)$.  Consider the contrapositive.  If $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x=y$.  We will prove this contrapositive.  In fact, this is almost always the way you prove a function is injective.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $x$ and $y$ be integers (in the domain).  Assume that $f(x) = f(y)$.  That means 
      \[3x + 7 = 3y +7.\]
      Subtract 7 from both sides:
      \[3x = 3y\]
      and then divide both sides by 3:
      \[x = y.\]
      Therefore $f$ is injective.
    \end{proof}
  \end{solution}
\end{example}

\section{Inverse Image}

When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say $x$) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write $f(x)$).  It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say $y$) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain get sent to it.  We could write ``those $x$ in the domain such that $f(x) = y$,'' but this is a lot of writing.  So here is some notation to make our lives easier.

Suppose $f:X \to Y$ is a function.  For $y \in Y$ (an element of the codomain), we write $f\inv(y)$ to represent the {\em set} of all elements in the domain $X$ which get sent to $y$.  That is, $f\inv(y) = \{x \in X \st f(x) = y\}$.

\vskip 1em
\noindent{\bf WARNING: $f\inv(y)$ is not an inverse function!!!!  Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but $f\inv(y)$ is defined for any function $f$.  The point: $f\inv(y)$ is a \underline{set}, not an element of the domain.}
\vskip 1em

\begin{example}
 Consider the function $f:\{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \to \{a,b,c,d\}$ given by $f(1) = a$, $f(2) = a$, $f(3) = b$, $f(4) = c$, $f(5) = c$ and $f(6) = c$.  Find the complete inverse image of each element in the codomain.
 \begin{solution}
  Remember, we are looking for sets.
  $f\inv(a) = \{1,2\}$\\
  $f\inv(b) = \{3\}$ \\
  $f\inv(c) = \{4,5,6\}$\\
  $f\inv(d) = \emptyset$.
 \end{solution}
\end{example}

\begin{example} Consider the function $g:\Z \to \Z$ defined by $g(n) = n^2 + 1$.  Find $g\inv(1)$, $g\inv(2)$, $g\inv(3)$ and $g\inv(10)$.
 \begin{solution}
  To find $g\inv(1)$, we need to find all integers $n$ such that $n^2 + 1 = 1$.  Clearly only 0 works, so $g\inv(1) = \{0\}$ (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).  
  
  To find $g\inv(2)$, we need to find all $n$ such that $n^2 + 1 = 2$.  We see $g\inv(2) = \{-1,1\}$.  
  
  If $n^2 + 1 = 3$, then we are looking for an $n$ such that $n^2 = 2$.  There are no such integers so $g\inv(3) = \emptyset$. 
  
  Finally, $g\inv(10) = \{-3, 3\}$ because $g(-3) = 10$ and $g(3) = 10$.
 \end{solution}

\end{example}

Since $f\inv(y)$ is a set, it makes sense to ask for $|f\inv(y)|$ - the number of elements in the domain which map to $y$.

\begin{example}
 Find a function $f:\{1,2,3,4,5\} \to \N$ such that $|f\inv(7)| = 5$.  
 \begin{solution}
 There is only one such function.  We need five elements of the domain to map to the number $7 \in \N$.  Since there are only five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7.  So $f(1) = 7$, $f(2) = 7$, $f(3) = 7$, $f(4) = 7$ and $f(5) = 7$.
 \end{solution}
\end{example}

The (constant) function we found in the above example is neither one-to-one nor onto.  In fact, we could have deduced that without even finding the function.  

Remember, a function is one-to-one (an injection) if each element in the codomain is the output for at most one input from the domain.  In terms of the inverse image, this can be restated as follows.

\begin{defbox}{Inverse Image and Injections}
 A function $f$ is injective (one-to-one) if and only if for every $y$ in the codomain, $|f\inv(y)| \le 1$.
\end{defbox}

Similarly, a function is onto (a surjection) if each element in the codomain is in the range - if each element in the codomain is the output of at least one input from the domain.  We can say this using inverse images as well.

\begin{defbox}{Inverse Image and Surjections}
 A function $f$ is surjective (onto) if and only if for every $y$ in the codomain, $|f\inv(y)| \ge 1$.
\end{defbox}

Putting these together, we get a characterization of the functions which are one-to-one and onto (the bijections).

\begin{defbox}{Inverse Image and Bijections}
 A function $f$ is a bijection if and only if for every $y$ in the codomain, $|f\inv(y)| = 1$.
\end{defbox}

Notice that in the case of bijections, the inverse image of each element in the codomain is a singleton set.  In this case would could define an inverse function, since each element the codomain is the image of exactly one element from the domain.  Without this condition, any attempt to ``undo'' the function with an inverse function would fail, because either an element from the codomain would not go to any element from the domain (if $f$ was not onto) or an element from the codomain would go to more than one element from the domain (if $f$ was not one-to-one).

\section{Functions and Cardinality}

Many of the functions we have seen so far have had finite domains and codomains.  For these functions, there is a connection between the cardinalities of the domain/codomain and whether the function is a injection/surjection/bijection.  Let's look at some examples.

\begin{example} Suppose $X$ is a finite set and $f:X \to Y$ is a injective function.  What can you say about $Y$?
  \begin{solution}
    Since $f$ is injective (that is, one-to-one), the elements of $X$ get sent to different elements in $Y$ - no two inputs have the same output.  This means that $Y$ has at least as many elements as $X$ does!  In other words, $|X| \le |Y|$.  
    
    Can we say more?  Yes! What happens when $|X| = |Y|$.  Then each element from $X$ is assigned its own element from $Y$, but since there are an equal number of elements in each set, all the elements of $Y$ are used up.  So nothing in $Y$ is omitted from the range.  This says that $f$ is also a surjection.  So if $f$ is injective and $|X| = |Y|$, then $f$ is in fact a bijection.
    The converse is also true: if $|X| < |Y|$ then there must be some elements of $Y$ not used.  So $f$ is not surjective.  
  \end{solution}

\end{example}

\begin{example} Suppose $Y$ is a finite set and $f: X \to Y$ is a surjective function.  What ca you say about $X$?
  \begin{solution}
    $f$ is surjective (onto) so every element of $Y$ is in the range.  Because $f$ is a {\em function}, each element of $X$ is sent to only one element of $Y$.  So we need at least as many elements in $X$ as we have in $Y$.  In other words, $|X| \ge |Y|$.
    
    What if $|X| = |Y|$?  In this case, since every element of $Y$ is used, each element of $Y$ is the output of only one element of $X$.  So $f$ is one-to-one as well, so is in fact a bijection. On the other hand, if $|X| > |Y|$ then it must be that two or more distinct elements of $X$ got sent to the same element in $Y$, so $f$ is not injective.
  \end{solution}

\end{example}

We can summarize these examples as follows:

\begin{defbox}{Functions and Cardinality}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets and $f: X \to Y$ be a function.  We then have:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $f$ is injective, then $|X| \le |Y|$.
    \item If $f$ is surjective, then $|X| \ge |Y|$.
    \item If $f$ is bijective, then $|X| = |Y|$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Additionally, in the case when $|X| = |Y|$, we have $f$ is injective if and only if $f$ is surjective.
\end{defbox}


\textbf{Note:}  The above works for {\em finite} sets $X$ and $Y$ but not necessarily for infinite $X$ and $Y$.  For example, there are many functions $f: \Z \to \Z$ which are one-to-one but not onto, and others which are onto but not one-to-one, even though $|\Z| = |\Z|$
