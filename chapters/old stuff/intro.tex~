% This is intro.tex.  This chapter will be some sort of introduction to discrete mathematics, the types of problems.



\subsection{The Mathematical Method}

Let's think briefly about the mathematical process.  What does it mean to {\em do math}?  Even up through calculus, doing math consists of solving a problem using one of the techniques your teacher showed you.  If you know how to use the technique, then the result of the technique (the ``answer'') is the solution to the problem.  How do you know the solution is correct?  Sometimes you can test your answer (for example, you can check division by multiplying) but then you are also trusting that your work in testing your answer is correct, and that you remembered the correct procedure to for testing your answer.  You can also go over your work again - double check all your computations.  But that will only give you as much confidence as you have in the technique you used to solve the problem.  Your teacher told you the technique works - maybe you think that your teacher wouldn't lie to you?  Even if you to possess (highly misguided) trust in your teachers, are you completely sure you remember what they taught you correctly?

Setting this healthy skepticism aside, as you continue your mathematical life journey, you will very soon (this semester in fact) encounter problems where the ``old way'' of doing math does not work.  In calculus, you learned that to find the absolute maximum value of the function $f(x)$ on an interval, you take the derivative of $f$, set it equal to zero, solve for $x$.  Then plug in these critical points as well as the end points into $f$ and select the largest.  This algorithm works (as long as $f$ is differentiable on the interval).  Hopefully your calculus instructor gave you some good reasons why this will always work.  But now you can solve these problems using this technique.  Now consider a problem you might see in a discrete or number theory class: how many positive integers have exactly two divisors?  I'm happy (yes, happy) to say there is no standard computational technique for answering questions like this (that is, how many numbers have property $P$?).  So what to do?

You might recognize the particular property - having exactly two divisors - as saying that the number is prime.  So how many primes are there?  More importantly, how are we going to find the solution to this problem?  We might start by listing some primes - can we think of a largest one?  No, it looks like any prime we think of, we can find one bigger.  So maybe there are infinitely many primes.  Let's go with that.  Now how confident are we?  So far, not very.  How can we ``check our work'' on this problem?  The way to do this, and the way to convince our friends that we have the right answer, is to construct an argument that our solution is correct.  And here is the wonderful thing about mathematics: the argument we will give will leave no doubt as to the truth of our solution.  

The arguments used in mathematics are valid deductive arguments with true premises.  Such an argument cannot have a false conclusion.  So we call such an arguments a {\em proof}.  Here is one for the theorem (i.e., important mathematical fact} that there are infinitely many primes:

\begin{theorem}
 There are infinitely many primes.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Suppose this were not the case - that there are only finitely many primes.  Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it $p$. Consider the number 
 \[N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1.\]
 Now $N$ is certainly larger than $p$.  Also, $N$ is not divisible by any number less than or equal to $p$, since every number less than or equal to $p$ divides $p!$.  Thus the prime factorization of $N$ contains prime numbers (possibly just $N$ itself) all greater than $p$.  Therefor $p$ is not the largest prime, a contradiction.  Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
\end{proof}

Are you convinced?  We will return to this argument and try to understand it a little better when we study logic.
