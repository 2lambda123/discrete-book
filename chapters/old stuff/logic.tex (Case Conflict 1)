\section{From Proofs to Logic}

One of the many fine reasons to study logic is to become better at reading and writing proofs.  Let's start by looking at a proof of a famous theorem a little more carefully:

\begin{theorem}
 There are infinitely many primes.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Suppose this were not the case - that there are only finitely many primes.  Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it $p$. Consider the number 
 \[N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1.\]
 Now $N$ is certainly larger than $p$.  Also, $N$ is not divisible by any number less than or equal to $p$, since every number less than or equal to $p$ divides $p!$.  Thus the prime factorization of $N$ contains prime numbers (possibly just $N$ itself) all greater than $p$.  Therefor $p$ is not the largest prime, a contradiction.  Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
\end{proof}

This proof is an example of a {\em proof by contradiction} - one of the standard styles of mathematical proof.  First and foremost, the proof is an argument - a sequence of statements, the last of which is the {\em conclusion} which follows from the previous statements.  The argument is valid - the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.  Let's go through the proof line by line.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Suppose there are only finitely many primes.

\hfill{\em this is a premise - note the use of ``suppose''}
\item  There must be a largest prime, call it $p$. 

\hfill{\em follows from line 1, by the definition of ``finitely many''}
\item Let $N = p! + 1$.

\hfill {\em basically just notation, although looking at $p! + 1$ is the key insight to the problem}
\item $N$ is larger than $p$

\hfill {\em by the definition of $p!$}
\item $N$ is not divisible by any number less than or equal to $p$ 

\hfill {\em by the definition of $p!$, $p!$ is divisible by each number less than or equal to $p$, so $p! + 1$ is not}
\item The prime factorization of $N$ contains prime numbers greater than $p$ 

\hfill {\em since $N$ is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of $N$, and by line 5.}
\item Therefore $p$ is not the largest prime.

\hfill {\em by line 6 - $N$ is divisible by a prime larger than $p$}
\item This is a contradiction.

\hfill {\em from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is $p$ and there is a prime larger than $p$}
\item Therefore there are infinitely many primes

\hfill {\em from line 1 and line 8: our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false}
\end{enumerate}

We should say a bit more about the last line.  Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise ``there are only finitely many primes'' and the conclusion ``there is a prime larger than the largest prime.''  This is a valid argument - each line follows from previous lines - so if the premises are true, then the conclusion {\em must} be true.  However, the conclusion is {\bf NOT} true - it is a contradiction, so necessarily false.  The only way out: the premise must be false.  


Here is another example.

\begin{theorem}
 For all integers $m$ and $n$, if $m\cdot n$ is even, then $m$ is even or $n$ is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Let $m$ and $n$ be integers, and assume $m$ and $n$ are odd.  Then $m = 2k +1$ for some integer $k$ and $n = 2l+1$ for some integer $l$.  Thus $m \cdot n = (2k+1)(2l+1) = 4kl+2k + 2l + 1$, which is odd.  Thus if $m \cdot n$ is even, then $m$ is even or $n$ is even.
\end{proof}

Now here is a line-by-line analysis of the proof.  

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Let $m$ and $n$ be integers. \hfill{\em define variables}
\item Assume $m$ and $n$ are odd. \hfill{\em premise}
\item Then $m = 2k+1$ and $n = 2l+1$ for integers $k$ and $l$ \hfill{\em by definition of ``odd''}
\item Thus $m \cdot n = (2k+1)(2l+1) = 4kl+2k + 2l + 1$. \hfill{\em by line 3 and arithmetic}
\item So $m\cdot n$ is odd. \hfill{\em by line 4, $m \cdot n = 2(2kl + k + l) + 1$, which is odd}
\item Thus if $m$ and $n$ are odd, then $m\cdot n$ is odd. \hfill{\em by lines 1 and 5}
\item Therefore if $m\cdot n$ is even, then $m$ is even or $n$ is even. \hfill{\em by line 6}
\end{enumerate}

Do you see why line 7 follows from line 6?  It has nothing to do with properties of integers, being even or odd, or any sort of normal mathematics.  It is purely logic.  Line 7 is what we call the {\em contrapositive} of line 6.  Logically, a statement is true if and only if its contrapositive is true. 

Notice how the proofs above contain mathematical content as well as logical content.  When reading or writing proofs, it is helpful to identify which steps are logic-based and which are mathematics based.  The math can be very complicated, so it is important to have a firm grasp on the logic of a proof.  This is one reason we are starting with a study of logic.


\section{Propositional Logic}
A proposition is another word of a statement.  Propositional logic studies the ways statements can interact with each other.  It is important to remember that propositional logic does not really care about the content of the statements.  For example, from a propositional logic statement point, the claims, ``if the moon is made of cheese then basketballs are round,'' and, ``if spiders have eight legs then Sam walks with a limp'' are exactly the same.  They are both statements of the form, ``if \textlangle something\textrangle then \textlangle something else\textrangle.''

Here's a question: is it true that when playing Monopoly, if you get more doubles than any other player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the most properties?  We will answer this question, and won't need to know anything about Monopoly.  Instead we will look at the logical form of the statement.  First though, let's back up and make sure we are very clear on some basics.

\begin{definition}
	A {\em statement} is any declarative sentence which is either true or false.
\end{definition}
\begin{example} These are statements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.
		\item The moon is made of cheese.
		\item 42 is a perfect square.
		\item Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
	\end{itemize}
	And these are not:
	\begin{itemize}
	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\item Would you like some cake?
		\item The sum of two squares.
		\item Go to your room!
		\item This sentence is false.\footnote{This is a tricky one.  Remember, a sentence is only a statement if it is either true or false.  Here, the sentence is not false, for if it were, it would be true.  It is not true, for that would make it false.}
		\item That's what she said.
		\end{multicols}
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}

The reason the last sentence is not a statement is because it contains variables (``that'' and ``she'').  Unless those are specified, the sentence cannot be true or false, and as such not a statement.  Other examples of this: $x + 3 = 7$.  Depending on $x$, this is either true or false, but as it stands it it neither.

You can build more complicated statements out of simpler ones using {\em logical connectives}.  For example, this is a statement: Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.  Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements.  The two shorter statements are {\em connected} by an ``and''.  We will consider 5 connectives: ``and'' (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), ``or'' (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), ``if\ldots then\ldots'' (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), ``if and only if'' (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and ``not'' (Sam is not a man).

Since we rarely care about the content of the individual statements, we can replace them with variables.  We use capital letters in the middle of the alphabet for these {\em propositional} (or {\em sentential}) variables: $P, Q, R, S\ldots$.  We also have symbols for the logical connectives: $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\imp$, $\iff$, $\neg$.

\begin{defbox}{Logical Connectives}
\begin{itemize}
 \item $P \wedge Q$ means  $P$ and $Q$, called a {\em conjunction}.
\item $P \vee Q$ means $P$ or $Q$, called a {\em disjunction}.
\item $P \imp Q$ means if $P$ then $Q$, called an {\em implication} or {\em conditional}.
\item $P \iff Q$ means $P$ if and only if $Q$, called a {\em biconditional}.
\item $\neg P$ means not $P$, called a {\em negation}.
\end{itemize}
\end{defbox}

The logical connectives allow us to construct longer statements out of simpler statements.  But the result is still a statement - it is either true or false.  Which it is can be determined by the truth or falsity of the parts, depending on the connectives.  

\begin{defbox}{Truth Conditions for Connectives}
\begin{itemize}
 \item $P \wedge Q$ is true when both $P$ and $Q$ are true
\item $P \vee Q$ is true when $P$ or $Q$ or both are true.\footnote{For us, ``or'' is the {\em inclusive or} so is always true when both $P$ and $Q$ are true}
\item $P \imp Q$ is true when $P$ is false or $Q$ is true or both.
\item $P \iff Q$ is true when $P$ and $Q$ are both true, or both false.
\item $\neg P$ is true when $P$ is false. 
\end{itemize}
\end{defbox}

I think all of these are obvious, except for $P \imp Q$.  Consider the statement, ``If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.''  This is definitely an implication: $P$ is the statement ``Bob gets a 90 on the final'' and $Q$ is the statement ``Bob will pass the class.'' Suppose I said that to you - in what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar?  What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class?  Then I have not lied to you, so my statement is true.  But if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false.  The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final?  Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't - did I lie in either case?  I think not.  In these last two cases, $P$ was false, and so was the statement $P \imp Q$.  In the first case, $Q$ was true, and so was $P \imp Q$.  So $P \imp Q$ is true when either $P$ is false or $Q$ is true.  Perhaps an easier way to look at it is this: $P \imp Q$ is {\em false} in only one case: if $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.  Otherwise, $P \imp Q$ is true.  Admittedly, there are times in English when this is not how ``if\ldots, then\ldots'' works.  However, in mathematics, we {\em define} the implication to work this way.


\subsection{Truth Tables}

To answer our question about monopoly, we need to decide when the statement $(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)$ is true.  Using the rules above, we see that either $P \imp Q$ is true or $Q \imp R$ is true (or both).  Those are true if either $P$ is false or $Q$ is true (in the first case) and $Q$ is false or $R$ is true (in the second case).  So... yeah, it gets kind of messy.  Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities.  Enter truth tables.  The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T's and F's (standing of course, for true and false) for each of the sentential variables, and then mark down whether the statement in question is true or false in that case.  We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's.  Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false.  For complicated statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.

All you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives.  Here they are:

\vskip 1ex
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 $P$ & $Q$ & $P\wedge Q$ \\ \hline
 T & T & T\\
 T & F & F\\
 F & T & F\\
 F & F & F
\end{tabular}\hfill
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 $P$ & $Q$ & $P\vee Q$ \\ \hline
 T & T & T\\
 T & F & T\\
 F & T & T\\
 F & F & F
\end{tabular}\hfill
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 $P$ & $Q$ & $P\imp Q$ \\ \hline
 T & T & T\\
 T & F & F\\
 F & T & T\\
 F & F & T
\end{tabular}\hfill
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 $P$ & $Q$ & $P\iff Q$ \\ \hline
 T & T & T\\
 T & F & F\\
 F & T & F\\
 F & F & T
\end{tabular}
\vskip 1ex

The truth table for negation looks like this:

\vskip 1ex
\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
 $P$ & $\neg P$ \\ \hline
 T & F \\
 F & T\\
\end{tabular}
}
\vskip 1ex

None of these truth tables should come as a surprise - they are all just restating the definitions of the connectives.  Let's try another one:

\begin{example}
 Make a truth table for the statement $\neg P \vee Q$.

\begin{solution}
Note that this statement is not $\neg(P \vee Q)$, the negation belongs to $P$ alone.  Here is the truth table:

 \begin{center}
	 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
 $P$ & $Q$ & $\neg P$ & $\neg P \vee Q$ \\ \hline
 T & T & F & T\\
 T & F & F & F\\
 F & T & T & T\\
 F & F & T & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We added a column for $\neg P$ to make filling out the last column easier.  The entries in the $\neg P$ column were determined by the entries in the $P$ column.  Then to fill in the final column, I look only at the column for $Q$ and the column for $\neg P$ and use the rule of $\vee$.  

You might notice that the final column is identical to the final column in the truth table for $P \imp Q$.  Since we listed the possible values for $P$ and $Q$ in the same (in fact, standard) order, this says that $\neg P \vee Q$ and $P \imp Q$ are {\em logically equivalent}
\end{solution}

\end{example}

Now let's answer our question about monopoly:

\begin{example}
  Analyze the statement, ``if you get more doubles than any other player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the most properties,'' using truth tables.
  
  \begin{solution}
    We note that we can represent the statement in symbols as $(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)$, where $P$ is the statement ``you get more doubles than any other player,'' $Q$ is the statement ``you will lose,'' and $R$ is the statement ``you must have bought the most properties.''  Now let's make a truth table.
    
    The truth table needs to contain 8 rows in order to account for every possible combination of truth and falsity among the three statements.  Here is the full truth table:
    
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
        $P$ & $Q$ & $R$ & $P \imp Q$ & $Q \imp R$ & $(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)$ \\ \hline
        T & T & T & T & T & T \\
        T & T & F & T & F & T \\
        T & F & T & F & T & T \\
        T & F & F & F & T & T \\
        F & T & T & T & T & T \\
        F & T & F & T & F & T \\
        F & F & T & T & T & T \\
        F & F & F & T & T & T
      \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
    The first three columns are simply a systematic listing of all possible combinations of T and F for the three statements (do you see how you would list the 16 possible combinations for four statements?).  The next two columns are determined by the values of $P$, $Q$, and $R$ and the definition of implication.  Then, the last column is determined by the values in the previous two columns and the definition of $\vee$.  It is this final column we care about.
    
    Notice that in each of the eight possible cases, the statement in question is true.  So our statement about monopoly is true (regardless of how many properties you own, how many doubles you roll, or whether you win or lose).
  \end{solution}
\end{example}

The statement about monopoly is an example of a {\em tautology} - a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone.  Tautologies are always true but they don't tell us much about the world.  No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true.  In fact, it is equally true that ``If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.''








\subsection{Rephrasing}

When reading or writing a proof, or even just trying to understand a mathematical statement, it can be very helpful to rephrase the statement.  But how do you know you are doing so correctly?  How do you know the two statements are equivalent?

One way is to make a truth table for each and ensure that the final columns of both are identical.  
We saw earlier that $P \imp Q$ is equivalent to $\neg P \vee Q$ because their truth tables agreed.  Now though we can just remember this fact - if we see the statement, ``if Sam is a man then Chris is a woman,'' we can instead think of it as ``Sam is a woman or Chris is a woman.''  You might also be tempted to rephrase further: ``Sam or Chris is a woman.''  This is okay of course, but that this second rephrasing is allowed is due to the meaning of ``is,'' not any of our logical connectives.  

Here are some common logical equivalences which can help rephrase mathematical statements:

\begin{defbox}{Double Negation}
  \[\neg \neg P \mbox{ is logically equivalent to } P\]
  Example: ``It is not the case that $c$ is not odd'' means ``$c$ is odd.''
\end{defbox}

No surprise there.  Now let's see how negation plays with conjunctions and disjunctions.

\begin{defbox}{De Morgan's Laws}
  \[\neg(P \and Q) \mbox{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \vee \neg Q\]
  \[\neg(P \vee Q) \mbox{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \and \neg Q\]
  Example: ``$c$ is not even or $c$ is not prime'' means ``$c$ is not both odd and prime''
\end{defbox}

Do you believe De Morgan's laws?  If not, make a truth table for each of them.  I think most of us get these right most of the time without thinking about them too hard.  If I told you that I had popcorn and goobers at the movies, but then you found out it was opposite day (so my statement was false) then you would agree, I hope, that I either did not have popcorn {\em or} did not have goobers (or didn't have either).  You would not insist that I could not have had either.

I should warn you that often in English, we are sloppy about our and's, or's and not's.  When you write about mathematics, you should be careful and write what you mean.  If you are not sure what to write, rephrasing carefully using De Morgan's can help you make sure that statement matches your intended meaning.

Now some rules for implications:

\begin{defbox}{Negation of Implication}
  \[\neg(P \imp Q) \mbox{ is logically equivalent to } P \and \neg Q\]
  In words: the only way for an implication to be false is for the ``if'' part to be true and the ``then'' part to be false.
\end{defbox}

This is very important, and not obvious - implications are tricky.  But look at the truth table for $P \imp Q$:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 $P$ & $Q$ & $P\imp Q$ \\ \hline
 T & T & T\\
 T & F & F\\
 F & T & T\\
 F & F & T
\end{tabular}

There is only one way for the implication to be false - $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.  Another way to see that this is true is by using De Morgan's Laws.  We saw earlier that $P \imp Q$ can be rephrased as $\neg P \vee Q$ so we have
\[\neg (P \imp Q) \mbox{ is logically equivalent to } \neg( \neg P \vee Q)\]
But by De Morgan's laws, $\neg( \neg P \vee Q)$ is equivalent to $\neg \neg P \and \neg Q$.  By double negation $\neg \neg P$ is the same as $P$.

While we are thinking about implications, we should talk about the converse and contrapositive:

\begin{defbox}{Converse and Contrapositive}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The {\em converse} of an implication $P \imp Q$ is the implication $Q \imp P$.  The converse is {\bf NOT} logically equivalent to the original implication.
    \item The {\em contrapositive} of an implication $P \imp Q$ is the statement $\neg Q \imp \neg P$.  An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.
  \end{itemize}

\end{defbox}

A related, but lesser used, term is the {\em inverse} of an implication.  The inverse of $P \imp Q$ is $\neg P \imp \neg Q$.  Notice that the inverse of an implication is the contrapositive of the converse.  Read that one more time.   Good.  So since implications and their contrapositives are logically equivalent, the inverse and converse of an implication are logically equivalent to each other, but not to the original implication.



\begin{example}
  Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93\% on her final, she will get an A in the class.  Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Sue gets a 93\% on her final.
    \item[(b)] Sue gets an A in the class.
    \item[(c)] Sue does not get a 93\% on her final.
    \item[(d)] Sue does not get an A in the class.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{solution} Note first that whenever $P \imp Q$ and $P$ are both true statements, $Q$ must be true as well.  For this problem, take $P$ to mean ``Sue gets a 93\% on her final'' and $Q$ to mean ``Sue will get an A in the class.''
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(a)] We have $P \imp Q$ and $P$ so $Q$ follows - Sue gets an A.
      \item[(b)] You cannot conclude anything - Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example.  Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an $A$, then she gets a 93\% on her final - that is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.
      \item[(c)] The inverse of $P \imp Q$ is $\neg P \imp \neg Q$, which states that if Sue does not get a 93\% on the final then she will not get an A in the class.  But this does not follow from the original implication.  Again, we can conclude nothing - Sue could have done extra credit.
      \item[(d)] What would happen if Sue does not get an A but {\em did} get a 93\% on the final.  Then $P$ would be true and $Q$ would be false.  But this makes the implication $P \imp Q$ false!  So it must be that Sue did not get a 93\% on the final.  Notice now we have the implication $\neg Q \imp \neg P$ - the contrapositive of $P \imp Q$.  Since $P \imp Q$ is assumed to be true, we know $\neg Q \imp \neg P$ is true as well - they are equivalent.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}
\end{example}


\section{Quantifiers and Predicate Logic}

So far we have seen how statements can be combined with logical symbols.  This is helpful when trying to understand a complicated mathematical statement - you can determine under which conditions the complicated statement is true.  However, we often want to do more.  For example, we started our investigation of logic by considering a proof of the statement ``for all integers $a$ and $b$, if $ab$ is even, then $a$ is even or $b$ is even.''  If we use propositional logic to analyze this statement, what should $P$ be?  

You might want to say $P$ is ``$ab$ is even'' so $Q$ can be ``$a$ is even'' and $R$ can be ``$b$ is even'' and say that the whole statement is therefore of the form $P \imp (Q \vee R)$.  This does not work!  One reason is that ``$ab$ is even'' is not a statement - it contains free variables, so it is not true or false (until the variables have values).  Another reason is that we have just lost the ``for all integers $a$ and $b$'' from our statement.  We can remedy both these problems using {\em Predicate Logic}.

\subsection{Predicates}

We can think of predicates as properties of objects.  For example, consider the predicate $E$ which we will use to mean ``is even.''  Being even is a property of some numbers, so $E$ needs to be applied to something.  We will adopt the notation $E(x)$ to mean $x$ is even.  (Some books would write $Ex$ instead.)  Notice that if we put a number in for $x$, then this becomes a statement - and as such can be true or false.  So $E(2)$ is true, and $E(3)$ is false.  On the other hand $E(x)$ is not true or false, since we don't know what $x$ is.  If we have a variable floating around like that, we say the expression is merely a formula, and not a statement.

Since $E(2)$ is a statement (a proposition), we can apply propositional logic to it.  Consider 
\[E(2) \and \neg E(3)\]
which is a true statement, because it is both the case that 2 is even and that 3 is not even.  What we have done here is capture the logical form (using connectives) of the statement ``2 is even and 3 is not'' as well as the mathematical content (using predicates).

Notice that we can only assert even-ness of a single number at a time.  That is to say, $E$ is a {\em one-place} predicate.  There are also predicates which assert a property of two or more numbers (or other objects) at the same time.  Consider the {\em two-place} predicate ``is less than.''  Perhaps we will use the variable $L$.  Now we can say $L(2,3)$, which is true because 2 is less than 3.  Of course we are already have a symbol for this: $2 < 3$.  However, what about ``divides evenly into'' as a predicate?  We can say $D(2,10)$ is true because 2 divides evenly into 10, while $D(3, 10)$ is false since there is a remainder when you divide 10 by 3.  Incidentally, there is a standard mathematical symbol for this: $2 | 10$ is read ``2 divides 10.''  

Predicates can be as complicated and have as many places as we want or need.  For example, we could $R(x,y,z,u,v,w)$ be the predicate asserting that $x$, $y$, $z$ are distinct natural numbers whose only common factor is $u$, the difference between $x$ and $y$ is $v$ and the difference between $y$ and $z$ is $w$.  This is a silly and most likely useless example, but it is an example of a predicate.  It is true of some ordered lists of six numbers (6-tuples), and false of others.  Additionally, predicates need not have anything to do with numbers: we could let $F(a,b,c,d)$ be the predicate that asserts that $a$ and $b$ are the only two children of mother $c$ and father $d$.

\subsection*{Quantifiers}

Perhaps the most important reason to use predicate logic is that doing so allows for quantification.  We can now express statements like ``ever natural number is either even or odd,'' and ``there is a natural number such that no number is less than it.''  Think back to Calculus and the Mean Value Theorem.  It states that for every function $f$ and every interval $(a, b)$, if $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the interval $(a,b)$, then there exists a number $c$ such that $a \le c \le b$ and $f'(c)(b - a) = f(b) - f(a)$.  Using the correct predicates and quantifiers, we could express this statement entirely in symbols.  

There are two quantifiers we will be interested in: existential and universal.  

\begin{defbox}{Quantifiers}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The existential quantifier is $\exists$ and is read ``there exists'' or ``there is.''  For example,
\[\exists x (x < 0)\]
asserts that there is a number less than 0.
\item The universal quantifier is $\forall$ and is read ``for all'' or ``every.''  For example,
\[\forall x (x \ge 0)\]
asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.
  \end{itemize}    
\end{defbox}

  Are these statements true?  Well, first notice that they cannot both be true.  In fact, they assert exactly the opposite of each other.  (Note that $x < y \iff \neg(x \ge y)$ -- although you might wonder what $x$ and $y$ are here, so it might be better to say $\forall x \forall y\left(x < y \iff \neg(x \ge y)\right)$.)  Which one is it though?  The answer depends entirely on our domain of discourse - the universe over which we quantify.  Usually, this universe is clear from the context.  If we are only discussing the natural numbers, then $\forall x \ldots$ means ``for every natural number $x \ldots$.''  On the other hand, in calculus we care about the real numbers, so it would mean ``for every real number $x \ldots$.''  If the context is not clear, we might right $\forall x \in \N\ldots$ to mean ``for every natural number $x\ldots$.''  Of course, for the two statements above, the second is true of the natural numbers, the first is true for any larger universe.\footnote{In this class we take the natural numbers to be 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}

Some more examples: to say ``every natural number is either even or odd,'' we would write, using $E$ and $O$ as the predicates for even and odd respectively:
\[\forall x (E(x) \vee O(x))\]
To say ``there is a number such that no number is less than it'' we would write:
\[ \exists x \forall y (y \ge x)\]
Actually, I did a little translation before I wrote that down.  The above statement would be literally read ``there is a number such that every number is greater than or equal to it.''  This of course amounts to the same thing.  However, if I wanted to be exact, I could have also written:
\[ \exists x \neg \exists y (y < x).\]
Notice also that say that there is a number for which no number is smaller is equivalent to saying that it is not the case that for every number there is a number smaller than it:
\[\neg \forall x \exists y (y < x).\]
That these three statements are equivalent is no coincidence.  To understand what is going on, we will need to better understand how quantification interacts with the logical connectives, specifically negation.

\subsection{Quantifiers and Connectives}

What does it mean to say that it is false that there is something that has a certain property?  Well, it means that everything does not have that property.  What does it mean for it to be false that everything has a certain property?  It means that there is something that doesn't have the property.  So in symbols, we have the following

\begin{defbox}{Quantifiers and Negation}
\[\neg \forall x P(x) \mbox{ is equivalent to } \exists x \neg P(x)\]
and
\[\neg \exists x P(x)\mbox{ is equivalent to } \forall x \neg P(x).\]
\end{defbox}

In other words, to move a negation symbol past a quantifier, you must switch the quantifier. This can be done multiple times:
\[\neg \exists x \forall y \exists z P(x,y,z) \mbox{ is equivalent to } \forall x \exists y \forall z \neg P(x,y,z).\]
Now we also know how to move negation symbols through other connectives (using De Morgan's Laws) so it is always possible to rewrite a statement so that the only negation symbols that appear are right in front of a predicate.  This hints at the possibility of having a standard form for all predicate statements.  However, to get this we must also understand how to move quantifiers through connectives.

Before we get too excited, let us note that we only need to worry about two connectives: $\and$ and $\vee$.  This is because we can rewrite $p \imp q$ as $\neg p \vee q$ (they are logically equivalent) and $p \iff q$ as $(p \and q) \vee (\neg p \and \neg q)$ (also logically equivalent).  

Let us consider an example to see what can happen.

\begin{example} 
  Let $E$ be the predicate for being even, and $O$ for being odd.  Consider:
\[\exists x E(x) \and \exists x O(x),\]
which says that there is a number which is even and a number which is odd.  This is of course true.  However there is no number which is both even and odd, so 
\[\exists x (E(x) \and O(x))\]
is false.  Note also that
\[\exists x (E(x) \vee O(x))\]
while true, is not really the same thing -- if $O$ is instead the predicate for ``is less than 0'' then the original statement is false, but this new one is true (of the natural numbers).  Changing the quantifier also doesn't help:
\[\forall x (E(x) \and O(x)\]
is false.  So what can we do?

The problem is that in the original sentence, the variable $x$ is doing double duty.  We want to express the fact that there is an even number and an odd number.  But that even number is in no way related to that odd number.  So we might as well have said
\[ \exists x E(x) \and \exists y O(y).\]
Now we can move the quantifiers out:
\[\exists x \exists y (E(x) \and O(y)).\]
\end{example}

The same thing works with $\vee$ and for both $\forall$ with either connective.  As long as there is no repeat in quantified variables we can move the quantifiers outside of conjunctions and disjunctions.  

A warning though: you cannot do this for $\imp$, at least not directly.\footnote{We must be similarly careful with $\iff$}  Let's see what happens.  

\begin{example}
Consider
\[ \forall x P(x) \imp \exists y Q(y)\]
for some predicates $P$ and $Q$.  This sentence is {\bf not} the same as
\[ \forall x \exists y (P(x) \imp Q(y)).\]
Remember that $p \imp q$ is the same as $\neg p \vee q$.  So the original sentence is really
\[\neg \forall x P(x) \vee \exists y Q(y).\]
Before we move the quantifiers out, we must move the $\forall x$ past the negation sign, which switches it to a $\exists x$:
\[\exists x \neg P(x) \vee \exists y Q(y).\]
Then we can finish by writing,
\[\exists x \exists y (\neg P(x) \vee Q(y))\]
or equivalently
\[\exists x \exists y (P(x) \imp Q(y)).\]
\end{example}

\section{From Logic to Proofs}

Now we return to proofs.  Since part of a mathematical proof is the logical structure, the hope is that our study of logic will make at least that side easier.  Here are some examples.

\begin{example} Prove: For all integers $n$, if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $n$ be an arbitrary integer.  Suppose $n$ is even.  Then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.  Now $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$.  Since $2k^2$ is an integer, $n^2$ is even.
  \end{proof}
  This is an example of a {\em direct} proof.  When proving an implication directly, you assume (suppose) the ``if...'' part (the hypothesis) and proceed to prove the ``then...'' part (the conclusion).  The statement is also a universal statement ($\forall n\ldots$).  We dealt with that by fixing an {\em arbitrary} integer.  
\end{example}
Now, what is the contrapositive of our statement?  It is, ``for all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is not even, then $n$ is not even.''  Is this true?  Yes - but we don't need a new proof - the contrapositive of a true statement is always true.

What about the converse?

\begin{example}
  Is the statement ``for all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even'' true?  
  \begin{solution}
    While the converse of a true statement need not be true, in this case it is.
    \begin{proof}
      We will prove the contrapositive: for all integers $n$ if $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.  Let $n$ be an arbitrary integers.  Suppose that $n$ is odd.  Then $n= 2k+1$ for some integer $k$.  Now $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$.  Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer, we see that $n^2$ is odd.  This completes the proof.
    \end{proof}

  \end{solution}

\end{example}

Notice we have now proved that if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even, as well as its converse, if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even.  Thus we have actually proved that $n$ is even if and only if $n^2$ is even. This gives us a guide for how to prove biconditionals: prove both implications separately.


Here is another example of how you might prove an implication:
  
  \begin{example} 
  Prove: for all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a + b$ is odd, then $a$ is odd or $b$ is odd.   What is the converse?  Is it true?
  \begin{solution}
    First we prove the original implication by proving its contrapositive.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.  Assume that $a$ and $b$ are even.  Then $a = 2k$ and $b = 2l$ for some integers $k$ and $l$.  Now $a + b = 2k + 2l = 2(k+1)$.  Since $k + l$ is an integer, we see that $a + b$ is even, completing the proof.
    \end{proof}
    Note that we really did prove the contrapositive - we assumed that ``$a$ is odd or $b$ is odd'' was false, which is to say $a$ and $b$ are even.  Then we derived $a + b$ is even, which is to say that it is false that $a + b$ is odd.
    
    The converse is the statement, ``for all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ is odd or $b$ is odd, then $a + b$ is odd.''  This is false!  How do we prove it is false?  We need to prove the negation of the converse.  Let's look at the symbols.  The converse is
    \[\forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))\]
    We want to prove the negation:
    \[\neg \forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))\]
    Simplify using the rules from the previous sections:
    \[\exists a \exists b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \and \neg O(a+b))\]
    As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from $\forall$ to $\exists$.  We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.  
    
    Now we know what to do.  To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers $a$ and $b$ so that $a$ is odd or $b$ is odd, but $a+b$ is not odd (so even).  That's easy: 1 and 3.  (remember, or means one or the other or both).
  \end{solution}
\end{example}

 We have seen how to prove some statements in the form of implications: either directly or by contrapositive.  Some statements aren't written as implications to begin with.
  
 \begin{example}
   Consider the statement, for every prime number $p$, either $p = 2$ or $p$ is odd.  We can rephrase this: for every prime number $p$, if $p \ne 2$, then $p$ is odd.  Now try to prove it.
   
   \begin{proof}
    Let $p$ be an arbitrary prime number.  Assume $p$ is not odd.  So $p$ is divisible by 2.  Since $p$ is prime, it must have exactly two divisors, and it has 2 as a divisor, so $p$ must be divisible by only 1 and 2.  Therefore $p = 2$.  This completes the proof (by contrapositive). 
   \end{proof}

 \end{example}


  
%   \item For example, let's try to prove that every prime number greater than 3 is either one more or one less than a multiple of 6.
%   
%   \item Even though it doesn't look like it, this is really an implication: for every number $n > 3$, if $n$ is a prime, then either $n = 6k + 1$ or $n = 6k-1$ for some $k$.
%   
%   \item How should we prove this?  First, let's think a bit why it might be true?
%   
%   \item Let's try to prove the contrapositive.  That is, for every number $n$, if it is not the case that $n = 6k+1$ or $n = 6k-1$ for some $k$, then $n$ is not prime. 
%   
%   \item Simplifying further: for every number $n$, if $n \ne 6k+1$ and $n \ne 6k-1$ for any $k$, then $n$ is composite.
%   
%   \begin{proof}
%     Let $n$ be an integer greater than 3, and assume $n \ne 6k+1$ and $n \ne 6k-1$ for any integer $k$.  Then for some integer $k$, $n = 6k+2$, $n = 6k+3$ or $n = 6k+4$.  
%     
%     Case 1: $n = 6k+2$.  Then $n$ is even, so not prime.
%     
%     Case 2: $n = 6k+3$.  Then $n$ is a multiple of 3, so not prime.
%     
%     Case 3: $n = 6k+4$.  Then $n$ is even, so not prime.
%     
%     So in any case, $n$ is not prime.
%   \end{proof}

There might be statements which really cannot be rephrased as implications.  For example, ``$\sqrt 2$ is irrational.''  In this case, it is hard to know where to start. What can we assume? Well, say we want to prove the statement $p$.  Now what if we could prove that $\neg p \imp q$ where $q$ was false?  If this implication is true, and $q$ is false, what can we say about $\neg p$?  It must be false as well - which makes $p$ true!  
  
This is why ``proof'' by contradiction works.  If we can prove that $\neg p$ leads to a contradiction, then the only conclusion is that $\neg p$ is false, so $p$ is true.  That's what we wanted to prove.

Here are a couple examples of proofs by contradiction.
  
  \begin{example}Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
  
  \begin{proof}
	Suppose not.  Then $\sqrt 2$ is equal to a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$.  Without loss of generality, assume $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest terms.  So,
	\[2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\]
	\[2b^2 = a^2\]
	Thus $a^2$ is even, and as such $a$ is even.  So $a = 2k$ for some integer $k$, and $a^2 = 4k^2$.  We then have,
	\[2b^2 = 4k^2\]
	\[b^2 = 2k^2\]
	Thus $b^2$ is even, and as such $b$ is even.  Since $a$ is also even, we see that $\frac{a}{b}$ is not in lowest terms, a contradiction.  Thus $\sqrt 2$ is irrational.
\end{proof}
 \end{example}
 
 \begin{example} Prove: there are no integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^2  = 4y + 2$. 
\begin{proof}
	We proceed by contradiction.  So suppose there {\em are} integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^2 = 4y + 2 = 2(2y + 1)$.  So $x^2$ is even.  We have seen that this implies that $x$ is even.  So $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$.  Then $x^2 = 4k^2$.  This in turn gives
	$2k^2 = (2y + 1)$.  But $2k^2$ is even, and $2y + 1$ is odd, so these cannot be equal.  Thus we have a contradiction, so there must not be any integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^2 = 4y + 2$.
\end{proof}
\end{example}
