% This is probability.tex.  The chapter will contain all material relating to probability.  Probably put this last, since it has a nice symetry with the counting chapter at the begining.

Most of us have a fiarly good intuitive idea of probability.  At the begining of a football game, the ref flips a coin, and the visitive team calls out either ``heads'' or ``tails.''  We would all agree that this is a fair way to decide who gets the ball first, as we all agree that the chances of winning such a coin flip are 1 in 2.  That is, half of the time you would win, the other half of the time you loose.  There are two possible outcomes (heads and tails), we assume the coin is {\em fair}, which is just to say that each of these two outcomes are equally likely, so the probability of getting heads is 1 out of 2, or $1/2$, or $50\%$, or $0.5$. 

Of course not every question in probability is as easy to understand.  After all, if everyone understood probability completely, no Vagas casino could stay in business!  In this chapter we will try to improve our grasp of probability.  We will see why some questions are more difficult than others, and how to solve them.  To begin, let us consider what is probably (ha!) the most famouse of trick probability questions.

\section{The Monty Hall Problem}

On the 1970s the game show {\em Let's Make a Deal}, hosted by Monty Hall, would offer contestants (chosen from the audience based on the creativity of their rediculous costumes) the chance of winning a brand new car.  The car was randomly placed behind one of three closed doors.  All the contestant had to do was guess which door obscured the car.  To make things more fun, the other two doors hid goats, or some other less-than-desirable prize.  Once the contestant picked a door (say door number 1), Monty Hall would then open one of the other two doors (say door number 3) revealing that it hid a goat.  Finally, because he was such a nice guy, Monty Hall would offer the contestant a chance to switch doors: either stay (with door 1) or switch (to door 2).  What should the contestant do?

Take a minute to think about this problem before reading on.  What would you do in this situation?  Do you think you are more likely to win the car if you stick with your original choice, or would your chances be better if you switched doors?  Of course, a third possibility is that both options are equally likely.  Is that the case?

If you are having trouble deciding on an answer, you are not alone.  In a 1990 issue of {\em Parade} magazine, Marilyn vos Savant wrote up a solution in her column.  After it was published, the magazine recieved nearly 10,000 letters, including 1,000 from people with PhDs, explaining why her answer was wrong.  These letters claimed that it makes no difference.  Consider another game wherein you flip a coin five times.  After flipping the coin four times, you notice that the coin has landded heads, tails, heads, tails.  What is the probability of the coin landing heads again?  Well, of course the previous results don't matter.  The probability of a coin landing heads up is $50\%$.  Similarly, it does not matter what door you originally pick, or what door was opened.  You now have two doors to choose from, and exactly one of them has a car. Thus the probability that the car is behind door number 1 is $50\%$, so it does not matter if you switch or not.

Sounds pretty good.  These thousands of people were so convinced by such an argument that they felt confident to write in to a nationally syndicated weekly magazine.  But perhaps as you have guessed by now, they were all wrong.  Marilyn vos Savant had the correct answer in her original article.  

Let's try an experiment.  With a friend, get three playing cards: two jokers and the queen of diamonds.  The queen will represent the car, an the jokers the goats.  Have your freind mix up the three cards, and let you pick one.  Without letting you see it, they should check all three cards and turn over one of the jokers (one of the cards you did not pick).  Then you get to choose whether to switch or not.  Try this game 30 times: 15 times switch, and 15 stay.  Record your results.  How many times did switching win you the queen?  How many times was staying the winning choice?

Hopefully your results are close to this: when you switch, you should have won 10 times and lost 5; when you stayed, you should have lost 10 times and only won 5 times.  This suggests the correct answer, that switching gives you a probability of winning of $2/3$, while staying with your original choice only has $1/3$ probability of success.  But if this is correct (and it is), then what is wrong with the $50/50$ argument above?  

Although there are two doors remaining (after Monty Hall reveals a goat), they are not equally likely to hide the car!  This is very important.  Consider the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow: there are two possibilities - either it does or it does not.  But we should all hope that the probability that the sun will rise is greater than $50\%$.  When confronted with two doors, you know that the car will be behind your originially chosen door only 1 out of 3 times.  So every other time (2 out of 3) the car will be behind either of the two other doors.  When Monty Hall reveals a goat, it does not change the fact that 2 out of every 3 times, the car will be behind the other door.  So the car is not equally likely to be behind either of the two doors.  

Still not conviced?  What if there were no goats: one door had a car, the other two had nothing.  You pick a door, and then have the option of either taking everything behind that door, or everything behind the other two doors.  What do you do now?  Clearly you should switch: you get two doors for the price of one!  Would this change if you knew that one of those two other doors had nothing behind it? Of course not - you already know that.

Whether you believe our explanation here or not, I hope you relize that the problem is tricky.  This happens often with probability problems.  I submit that this is a good thing: it give us an opportunity to exercise our minds on complex questions, even though the background material behind questions is very simple.  

\section{Probability Basics}

As we have said, most everyone has a basic understanding of the basics of probability.  Therefore the following might seem unnecessary and overly cautious.  But remember that even relatively simple problems can get complicated quickly, so we should make sure our basics are soundly understood.

The probability that a coin lands heads up is $1/2$.  The probability of rolling a 1 on a fiar six sided die is $1/6$.  The probability that the little white ball will land on double 0 on a roulette wheel (with 38 slots) is $1/38$. The probability of drawing a heart out of a regular deck of well shuffled cards is $13/52$.  In general, if you run some experiment, the probability of a particular event, which can happen $m$ ways out of a total of $n$ equally likely outcomes, is $m/n$.  That is:

\begin{definition}
 The probability of event $A$ occuring is
\[P(A) = \frac{\mbox{Number of ways $A$ can occur}}{\mbox{Number of all (equally likely) outcomes}}\]
\end{definition}

When you flip a coin, there are a total of 2 equally likely outcomes: heads and tails.  There is only one way the event ``heads'' can occur.  Thus $P(\mbox{heads}) = 1/2$.  There are six equally outcomes when rolling a six sided die; only one way the event ``a 1 is rolled'' can happen, so $P(1) = 1/6$.  There are 38 outcomes on a roulette whell, only one of them is double 0, so $P(00) = 1/38$.  There are a total of 52 outcomes when drawing a single card, and there are 13 ways the card could be a heart, so $P(\mbox{heart}) = 13/52$.  Of course $13/52 = 1/4$ when reduced.  This makes sense: there are a total of four suits which could be drawn, and only one of them is a heart.

Notice that the probability of an event occuring is a fraction.  Now we can write that fraction as a decimal (as in the probability of getting a hear it $.25$) or as a percentage ($25\%$), but we will mostly choose not too simply to stress the definition.  Also, while we can reduce fractions, often it is useful not to so that both the number of ways $A$ can occur, and the total number of outcomes can be explicitly displayed.  

\begin{question}
 All probabilities are fractions.  Is every fraction the probability of some event?
\end{question}

Can you think of an experiment for which an event has probability $2/7$?  Well, coins don't seem to work, and I've never seen any dice with seven sides.  But how about this: you make a spinner with seven equal regions, and color two of those regions blue.  Then the probability of the sminner landing on blue is $2/7$.  You could imagine spinners with any number of regeons, with any number of them colored blue.  Does this get every fraction?

No! What about improper fractions?  Is there an event which has probability $4/3$?  How could this be?  If $P(A) = 4/3$, then there are 4 ways for the even to occur, and 3 total equally likely outcomes.  But how can there be more ways for event $A$ to occur than the total number of outcomes?  There can't be.  When written as a fraction, the probability of an event is a fraction with numerator no greater than the denomenator.  In other words, probabilities cannot be greater than 1.  It is possible for the probability of an event to be 1: for example, what is the probability of getting either heads or tails when you flip a coin?  There are 2 total outcomes, and there are 2 ways the event can occure.  So the probability is $2/2 = 1 = 100\%$.  

On the other hand, by the very definition of probability, both the numerator and the denomenator must be non-negative whole numbers.  So the probability of an event cannot be less than zero.  Of course there are events that have probability zero.  For example, what is the probability of getting a 7 when you role a regular six-sided die?  Well there are six total outcomes, and none of them are a 7.  So the probability is $0/6 = 0 = 0\%$.  Thus we have:

\begin{probfact} 
The probability of an event is always a number ranging from 0 to 1 (inclusive). 
\end{probfact}

\begin{remark}
 For us, probabilities are always rational numbers (fractions), but of course there are more numbers between zero and one than just these.  If we were interested in continuous probability, then probabilities could be any real number from 0 to 1.  The definition of probability in the continuous case is considerably more complicated than anything we are doing here.
\end{remark}

Let's see what else we can deduce about probability.  We know that the probability of rolling a one on a six-sided die is $1/6$.  What then is the probability of {\em not} rolling a one?  This is the same as asking for the probability of rolling two, three, four, five, or six.  So there are five ways the event (not rolling a one) can happen, out of a total of six outcomes.  So the probability is $5/6$.  

What about the probability of not getting double zero on the roulette wheel?  We could go an list every outcome which is not double zero, and count them up.  This seems like too much work.  Instead, think of it this way: of the 38 total outcomes, only one of them is double zero.  This means there are 37 outcomes which are {\em not} double zero.  So the probability of not getting double zero is $37/38$.  

This will always work.  If the probability of event $A$ occuring is $m/n$, then there are $m$ ways for event $A$ to occur, out of $n$ total outcomes.  So then the there are $n-m$ ways that $A$ could {\em not} occur, still out of $n$ total outcomes.  So the probability of $A$ {\em not} occuring (written $P(\bar A)$) is $(n-m)/n$.  Notice that
\[\frac{n-m}{n} = \frac{n}{n} - \frac{m}{n} = 1 - \frac{m}{n}\]
In other words, we have:

\begin{probfact}
 \[P(\bar A) = 1 - P(A)\]
That is, the probability of an event not occuring is 1 minus the probability of the event occuring.
\end{probfact}
