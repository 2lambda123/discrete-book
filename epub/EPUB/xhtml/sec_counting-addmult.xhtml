        Here we have six events: the first letter, the second letter, the third letter, the first digit, the second digit, and the third digit. The first three events can each happen in 26 ways; the last three can each happen in 10 ways. So the total number of license plates will be \(26\cdot 26\cdot 26 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10\), using the multiplicative principle.
      </p>
              <p id="p-448">
        Does this make sense? Think about how we would pick a license plate. How many choices we would have? First, we need to pick the first letter. There are 26 choices. Now for each of those, there are 26 choices for the second letter: 26 second letters with first letter A, 26 second letters with first letter B, and so on. We add 26 to itself 26 times. Or quicker: there are \(26 \cdot 26\) choices for the first two letters.
      </p>
              <p id="p-449">
        Now for each choice of the first two letters, we have 26 choices for the third letter. That is, 26 third letters for the first two letters AA, 26 choices for the third letter after starting AB, and so on. There are \(26 \cdot 26\) of these \(26\) third letter choices, for a total of \((26\cdot26)\cdot 26\) choices for the first three letters. And for each of these \(26\cdot26\cdot26\) choices of letters, we have a bunch of choices for the remaining digits.
      </p>
              <p id="p-450">
        In fact, there are going to be exactly 1000 choices for the numbers. We can see this because there are 1000 three-digit numbers (000 through 999). This is 10 choices for the first digit, 10 for the second, and 10 for the third. The multiplicative principle says we multiply: \(10\cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000\).
      </p>
              <p id="p-451">
        All together, there were \(26^3\) choices for the three letters, and \(10^3\) choices for the numbers, so we have a total of \(26^3 \cdot 10^3\) choices of license plates.

    Careful: “and” doesn't mean “times.” For example, how many playing cards are both red and a face card? Not \(26 \cdot 12\). The answer is 6, and we needed to know something about cards to answer that question.
  </p>
      <p id="p-453">
    Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more like the multiplicative principle (you are counting two separate events) but the answer is not \(26 \cdot 12\) here either. The problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>for each</em> of those there are 12 ways to select the second card. If the first card was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second card.

        Remember that a function sends each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain.  To determine a function, we just need to specify the image of each element in the domain.  Where can we send 1?  There are 4 choices.  Where can we send 2?  Again, 4 choices.  What we have here is 5 “events” (picking the image of an element in the domain) each of which can happen in 4 ways (the choices for that image).  Thus there are \(4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 4^5\) functions.

        This is more than just an example of how we can use the multiplicative principle in a particular counting question.  What we have here is a general interpretation of certain applications of the multiplicative principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects: functions.  Whenever we have a counting question that asks for the the number of outcomes of a repeated event, we can interpret that as asking for the number of functions from \(\{1,2,\ldots, n\}\) (where \(n\) is the number of times the event is repeated) to  \(\{1,2,\ldots,k\}\) (where \(k\) is the number of ways that event can occur).

        <p id="p-458">
      To make things clearer, and more mathematically rigorous, we will use sets. Do not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying to give a proof of these principles, but we are doing a lot more. If we understand the additive and multiplicative principles rigorously, we will be better at applying them, and knowing when and when not to apply them at all.

      We will look at the additive and multiplicative principles in a slightly different way. Instead of thinking about event \(A\) and event \(B\), we want to think of a set \(A\) and a set \(B\). The sets will contain all the different ways the event can happen. (It will be helpful to be able to switch back and forth between these two models when checking that we have counted correctly.)

          By now you should agree that the answer to the first question is \(9 \cdot 5 = 45\) and the answer to the second question is \(9 + 5 = 14\). These are the multiplicative and additive principles. There are two events: picking a shirt and picking a pair of pants. The first event can happen in 9 ways and the second event can happen in 5 ways. To get both a shirt and a pair of pants, you multiply. To get just one article of clothing, you add.
        </p>
                <p id="p-464">
          Now look at this using sets. There are two sets, call them \(S\) and \(P\). The set \(S\) contains all 9 shirts so \(|S| = 9\) while \(|P| = 5\), since there are 5 elements in the set \(P\) (namely your 5 pairs of pants). What are we asking in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want \(|S \cup P|\), the number of elements in the union of shirts and pants. This is just \(|S| + |P|\) (since there is no overlap; \(|S \cap P| = 0\)). Question 1 is slightly more complicated. Your first guess might be to find \(|S \cap P|\), but this is not right (there is nothing in the intersection). We are not asking for how many clothing items are both a shirt and a pair of pants. Instead, we want one of each. We could think of this as asking how many pairs \((x,y)\) there are, where \(x\) is a shirt and \(y\) is a pair of pants. As we will soon verify, this number is \(|S| \cdot |P|\).

         Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), if \(A \cap B = \emptyset\) (that is, if there is no element in common to both \(A\) and \(B\)), then

      This hardly needs a proof. To find \(A \cup B\), you take everything in \(A\) and throw in everything in \(B\). Since there is no element in both sets already, you will have \(\card{A}\) things and add \(\card{B}\) new things to it. This is what adding does! Of course, we can easily extend this to any number of disjoint sets.

      Let \(A = \{a_1,a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_m\}\) and \(B = \{b_1,b_2, b_3, \ldots, b_n\}\) (so \(\card{A} = m\) and \(\card{B} = n\)). The set \(A \times B\) contains all pairs with the first half of the pair being some \(a_i \in A\) and the second being one of the \(b_j \in B\). In other words:
      \begin{align*}
 A \times B = \{ \amp (a_1, b_1), (a_1, b_2), (a_1, b_3), \ldots (a_1, b_n),\\

      Each row above is really \(\{a_i\} \times B\) for some \(a_i \in A\). That is, we fixed the \(A\)-element. Broken up this way, we have

       While we are thinking about sets, consider what happens to the additive principle when the sets are NOT disjoint. Suppose we want to find \(\card{A \cup B}\) and know that \(\card{A} = 10\) and \(\card{B} = 8\). This is not enough information though. We do not know how many of the 8 elements in \(B\) are also elements of \(A\). However, if we also know that \(\card{A \cap B} = 6\), then we can say exactly how many elements are in \(A\), and, of those, how many are in \(B\) and how many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in \(B\), so 4 are in \(A\) but not in \(B\)). We could fill in a Venn diagram  as follows:
    </p>
        <figure class="figure-like" id="figure-26">
          <object type="image/svg+xml" style="width:40%; margin:auto; display:block;" data="images/image-29.svg" alt="">

          </object>
        </figure>
        <p id="p-482">
      This says there are 6 elements in \(A \cap B\), 4 elements in \(A \setminus B\) and 2 elements in \(B \setminus A\). Now <!--Style me with CSS--><em>these</em> three sets <!--Style me with CSS--><em>are</em> disjoint, so we can use the additive principle to find the number of elements in \(A \cup B\). It is \(6 + 4 + 2 = 12\).
    </p>
        <p id="p-483">
      This will always work, but drawing a Venn diagram is more than we need to do. In fact, it would be nice to relate this problem to the case where \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint. Is there one rule we can make that works in either case?
    </p>
        <p id="p-484">
      Here is another way to get the answer to the problem above. Start by just adding \(\card{A} + \card{B}\). This is \(10 + 8 = 18\), which would be the answer if \(\card{A \cap B} = 0\). We see that we are off by exactly 6, which just so happens to be \(\card{A \cap B}\). So perhaps we guess,
      \begin{equation*}
        \card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A \cap B}.
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
        <p id="p-485">
      This works for this one example. Will it always work? Think about what we are doing here. We want to know how many things are either in \(A\) or \(B\) (or both). We can throw in everything in \(A\), and everything in \(B\). This would give \(\card{A} + \card{B}\) many elements. But of course when you actually take the union, you do not repeat elements that are in both. So far we have counted every element in \(A \cap B\) exactly twice: once when we put in the elements from \(A\) and once when we included the elements from \(B\). We correct by subtracting out the number of elements we have counted twice. So we added them in twice, subtracted once, leaving them counted only one time.

For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2 of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemestry, and 1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as the elements of the set \(A\), and similarly for sets \(B\) and \(C\). The one student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set \(A \cap B \cap C\). Thus, in Venn diagrams:

          We found 5 goes in the “\(A\) only” region because the entire circle for \(A\) needed to have a total of 12, and 7 were already accounted for. Similarly, we calculate the “\(B\) only” region to contain only 1 student and the “\(C\) only” region to contain no students.

      Could we have solved the problem above in an algebraic way? While the additive principle generalizes to any number of sets, when we add a third set here, we must be careful. With two sets, we needed to know the cardinalities of \(A\), \(B\), and \(A \cap B\) in order to find the cardinality of \(A \cup B\). With three sets we need more information. There are more ways the sets can combine. Not surprisingly then, the formula for cardinality of the union of three non-disjoint sets is more complicated:

Also, each element in both \(A\) and \(C\) is counted twice, as are elements in \(B\) and \(C\), so we take each of those out of our sum once. But now what about the elements which are in \(A \cap B \cap C\) (in all three sets)? We added them in three times, but also removed them three times. They have not yet been counted. Thus we add those elements back in at the end.

      Returning to our example above, we have \(\card{A} = 12\), \(\card{B} = 5\), \(\card{C} = 8\). We also have \(\card{A \cap B} = 2\), \(\card{A \cap C} = 6\), \(\card{B \cap C} = 3\), and \(\card{A \cap B \cap C} = 1\). Therefore:
      \begin{equation*}
        \card{A \cup B \cup C} = 12 + 5 + 8 - 2 - 6 - 3 + 1 = 15
      \end{equation*}

      This is what we got when we solved the problem using Venn diagrams.

      This process of adding in, then taking out, then adding back in, and so on is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion</em>, or simply PIE. We will return to this counting technique later to solve for more complicated problems (involving more than 3 sets).

          We usually write numbers in decimal form (or base 10), meaning numbers are composed using 10 different “digits” \(\{0,1,\ldots, 9\}\). Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers <em class="terminology">hexadecimal</em> or base 16. Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers: \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 9, \mathrm{A, B, C, D, E, F}\}\). So for example, a 3 digit hexadecimal number might be 2B8.
