For each choice of first letter, there are 5 choices for the second letter (we cannot repeat the first letter; we are rearranging letters and only have one of each), and for each of those, there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter.

          Remember what it means for a function to be bijective: each element in the codomain must be the image of exactly one element of the domain. Using two-line notation, we could write one of these bijections as
          \begin{equation*}
            f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8} {3 \amp 1 \amp 5 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 6 \amp 2 \amp 4}
          \end{equation*}
          What we are really doing is just rearranging the elements of the codomain, so we are creating a permutation of 8 elements. In fact, “permutation” is another term used to describe bijective functions from a finite set to itself.

              <p id="p-654">
          If you believe this, then you see the answer must be \(8! = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot\cdots\cdot 1 = 40320\). You can see this directly as well: for each element of the domain, we must pick a distinct element of the codomain to map to. There are 8 choices for where to send 1, then 7 choices for where to send 2, and so on. We multiply using the multiplicative principle.

            This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters, only now we have more choices for each letter. For the first letter, there are 6 choices. For each of those, there are 5 choices for the second letter. Then there are 4 choices for the third letter, and 3 choices for the last letter. The total number of words is \(6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360\). This is not \(6!\) because we never multiplied by 2 and 1. We could start with \(6!\) and then cancel the 2 and 1, and thus write \(\frac{6!}{2!}\).

        In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of \(k\) objects choosing those objects from a larger collection of \(n\) objects. (In the example above, \(k = 4\), and \(n = 6\).) We write this number \(P(n,k)\) and sometimes call it a <em class="terminology">\(k\)-permutation of \(n\) elements</em>. From the example above, we see that to compute \(P(n,k)\) we must apply the multiplicative principle to \(k\) numbers, starting with \(n\) and counting backwards. For example
        \begin{equation*}
          P(10, 4) = 10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7.
        \end{equation*}
      </p>
      <p id="p-659">
        Notice again that \(P(10,4)\) starts out looking like \(10!\), but we stop after 7. We can formally account for this “stopping” by dividing away the part of the factorial we do not want:
        \begin{equation*}
          P(10,4) = \frac{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10!}{6!}.
        \end{equation*}
      </p>
      <p id="p-660">
        Careful: The factorial in the denominator is not \(4!\) but rather \((10-4)!\).

          Here is another way to find the number of \(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements: first select which \(k\) elements will be in the permutation, then count how many ways there are to arrange them. Once you have selected the \(k\) objects, we know there are \(k!\) ways to arrange (permute) them. But how do you select \(k\) objects from the \(n\)? You have \(n\) objects, and you need to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>choose</em> \(k\) of them. You can do that in \({n \choose k}\) ways. Then for each choice of those \(k\) elements, we can permute <!--Style me with CSS--><em>them</em> in \(k!\) ways. Using the multiplicative principle, we get another formula for \(P(n,k)\):
          \begin{equation*}
            P(n,k) = {n \choose k}\cdot k!.
          \end{equation*}
        </p>
      <p id="p-668">
          Now since we have a closed formula for \(P(n,k)\) already, we can substitute that in:
          \begin{equation*}
            \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = {n \choose k} \cdot k!.
          \end{equation*}
        </p>
      <p id="p-669">
          If we divide both sides by \(k!\) we get a closed formula for \({n \choose k}\).

          We say \(P(n,k)\) counts <!--Style me with CSS--><em>permutations</em>, and \({n \choose k}\) counts <!--Style me with CSS--><em>combinations</em>. The formulas for each are very similar, there is just an extra \(k!\) in the denominator of \({n \choose k}\). That extra \(k!\) accounts for the fact that \({n \choose k}\) does not distinguish between the different orders that the \(k\) objects can appear in. We are just selecting (or choosing) the \(k\) objects, not arranging them. Perhaps “combination” is a misleading label. We don't mean it like a combination lock (where the order would definitely matter). Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors
          — you just need to decide which flavors to combine, not the order in which to combine them.

Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14.  So the answer is \(P(14, 6)\), which can be calculated as \(\frac{14!}{8!} = 2192190\).
</p>
                  <p id="p-678">
  Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).
</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p id="p-679">
              How are these numbers related? Notice that \(P(14,6)\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>much</em> larger than \({14 \choose 6}\). This makes sense. \({14 \choose 6}\) picks 6 friends, but \(P(14,6)\) arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say exactly how much larger \(P(14,6)\) is. In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly \(6!\) ways. So now we have \(3003\cdot 6!\) choices and that is exactly \(2192190\).
            </p>
              <p id="p-680">
              Alternatively, look at the first problem another way. We want to select 6 out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they are selected in. To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:
              \begin{equation*}
                14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9.
              \end{equation*}
            </p>
              <p id="p-681">
              This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly \(2192190 = P(14,6)\)). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely \(6!\) ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is
              \begin{equation*}
                \frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}.
              \end{equation*}
            </p>
              <p id="p-682">
              Note that another way to write this is
              \begin{equation*}
                \frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!}.
              \end{equation*}
              which is what we had originally.
