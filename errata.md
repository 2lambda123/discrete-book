# Errata for 2nd Edition

Many errors were fixed in preparation of the 2nd edition, but thanks in part to the careful reading by students and instructors, more have been revealed.  Over Summer 2017, I will correct many of these errors and release a corrected 2nd edition in time for Fall 2017.  Moving forward, as errors are found, I will record them below.

## Errors not yet corrected

### Major errors

(updated 6/23/2017)

Page numbers match print and tablet pdf edition.

* Exercise 4.2.3 (page 218) and its solution (page 312): This problem is broken.  As stated, there is no polyhedron that satisfies the statement of the problem.


### Minor typos




## Errors Corrected Summer 2017

In case you have a copy of the book printed prior to July 2017, you will find the following errors that have since been corrected.  Typos are not included below, unless they affect content.

* Exercise 0.4.5(d) (page 38): the piecewise definition is missing *n* (should read, "if *n* is even/if *n* is odd").

* Exercise 0.4.13 (page 39): the piecewise definition is missing *n*.

* Exercise 2.2.1(f) solution (page 294): The closed formula is wrong.  it should be 1+(4n+6)n/2.

* Examples 2.2.6 and 2.3.1-1: both of these start with the wrong sequence, which should be 2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37,..., to match the solution given.

* Exercise 2.3.1(b) solution (page 296): the formula should be a_n = n^2 + n.

* Exercise 2.4.8 (page 146): The second term should be \beta a_{n-2}.

* Exercise 4.1.4 (page 206): In graph 1, the last edge should be {c,d} and not {c,e} (otherwise, the answer in the back is wrong).

* Exercise 4.1.6 solution (page 311): The middle graph was labeled incorrectly.
