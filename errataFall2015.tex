\begin{itemize}
%Thanks to Ryan Coon, 9/12/15:
\item Exercise 1.1.4: The question is ambiguous and the supplied answer is wrong anyway.  A better phrasing of the question would be the following. ``For the rest of your outfit, you have 5 shirts, 4 skirts, 3 pants, and 7 dresses.  You want to select either a shirt to wear with a skirt or pants, or just a  dress.  How many outfits do you have to choose from?''  The answer should be $5\cdot (4+3) + 7 = 42$.
