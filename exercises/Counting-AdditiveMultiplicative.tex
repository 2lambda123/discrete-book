\question Consider all 5 letter ``words'' made from the letters $a$ through $h$.
\begin{parts}
 \part How many of these words are there total?
 \part How many of these words contain no repeated letters?
 \part How many of these words (repetitions allowed) start with the sub-word ``aha''?
 \part How many of these words (repetitions allowed) either start with ``aha'' or end with ``bah'' or both?
 \part How many of the words containing no repeats also do not contain the sub-word ``bad'' (in consecutive letters)?  
\end{parts}

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{parts}
      \part $8^5$, since you select from 8 letters 5 times.  %How many of these words are there total?
      \part $8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4$.  After selecting a letter, you have fewer letters to select for the next one.  %How many of these words contain no repeated letters?
      \part 64 - you need to select the 4th and 5th letters. %How many of these words (repetitions allowed) start with the sub-word ``aha''?
      \part $64 + 64 - 0 = 128$.  There are 64 words which start with ``aha'' and another 64 words that end with ``bah.''  Perhaps we over counted the words that both start with ``aha'' and end with ``bah'' but since the words are only 5 letters long, there are no such words.  %How many of these words (repetitions allowed) either start with ``aha'' or end with ``bah'' or both?
      \part $(8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4) - 3\cdot (5\cdot 4) = 6660$. All the words minus the bad ones.  The taboo word can be in any of three positions (starting with letter 1, 2, or 3) and for each position we must choose the other two letters (from the remaining 5 letters) %How many of the words containing no repeats also do not contain the sub-word ``bad'' (in consecutive letters)?  
    \end{parts}
  \end{answer}
