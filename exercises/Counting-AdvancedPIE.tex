\question Ten ladies of a certain age drop off their red hats at the hat check of a museum.  As they are leaving, the hat check attendant gives the hats back randomly.  In how many ways can exactly six of the ladies receive their own hat (and the other four not)?

	\begin{answer}
	${10 \choose 6}\left(4! - \left[{4 \choose 1} 3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3}1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right]\right)$.  We choose 6 of the 10 ladies to get their own hat, and the multiply by the number of ways the remaining hats can be deranged.
