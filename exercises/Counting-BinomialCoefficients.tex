\question How many 10-bit strings contain 6 or more 1's?

  \begin{answer}
    ${10 \choose 6} + {10\choose 7} + {10\choose 8} + {10 \choose 9} + {10\choose 10} = 386$ 
  \end{answer}



\question What is the coefficient of $x^9$ in the expansion of $(x+1)^{14} + x^3(x+2)^{15}$?

  \begin{answer}
    Use the binomial theorem.  ${14\choose 9} + {15 \choose 6}2^9$.
  \end{answer}



\question Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
\begin{parts}
  \part How many subsets are there total? 
  \part How many subsets contain $\{2,3,5\}$ as a subset?
  \part How many subsets of $S$ contain no prime numbers?
  \part How many subsets contain at least one odd number? 
  \part How many doubletons (i.e., subsets of two elements) contain exactly one even number?
\end{parts}

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{parts}
      \part $2^6 = 64$  %How many subsets are there total? 
      \part $2^3 = 8$.  We need to select yes/no for each of the remaining three elements.  %How many subsets contain $\{2,3,5\}$ as a subset?
      \part $2^3 = 8$.  We need to decide yes/no for the three non-prime elements.  %How many subsets of $S$ contain no prime numbers?
      \part $2^6 - 2^3 = 56$.  There are 8 subsets which do not contain any odd numbers. %How many subsets contain at least one odd number? 
      \part 9.  We need to select one odd (3 choices) and one even (3 choices).  %How many doubletons (i.e., subsets of two elements) contain exactly one even number?
    \end{parts}

\question How many shortest lattice paths start at (3,3) and
\begin{parts}
  \part end at (10,10)?
  \part end at (10,10) and pass through (5,7)?
  \part end at (10,10) and avoid (5,7)?
\end{parts}   

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{parts}
      \part ${14 \choose 7}$ %end at (10,10)?
      \part ${6 \choose 2}{8\choose 5}$ %end at (10,10) and pass through (5,7)?
      \part ${14 \choose 7} - {6\choose 2}{8 \choose 5}$ %end at (10,10) and avoid (5,7)?
    \end{parts} 
  \end{answer}
