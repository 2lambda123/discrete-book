\question A pizza parlor offers 10 toppings.
\begin{parts}
 \part How many 3-topping pizzas could they put on their menu?  Assume double toppings are not allowed.
 \part How many total pizzas are possible, with between zero and ten toppings (but not double toppings) allowed?
 \part The pizza parlor will list the 10 toppings in two columns on their menu.  How many ways can they arrange the toppings in the left column?
\end{parts}

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{parts}
      \part ${10 \choose 3}$ %How many 3-topping pizzas could they put on their menu?  Assume double toppings are not allowed.
      \part $2^{10}$ %How many total pizzas are possible, with between zero and ten toppings (but not double toppings) allowed?
      \part $P(10,5)$  %The pizza parlor will list the 10 toppings in two columns on their menu.  How many ways can they arrange the toppings in the left column?
    \end{parts}
  \end{answer}





\question How many quadrilaterals can you draw using the dots below as vertices (corners)?

\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.9]
  \foreach \x in {-3,...,3}
  \foreach \y in {-1,1}
  \fill (\x,\y) circle (3pt);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

  \begin{answer}
    ${7\choose 2}{7\choose 2}$
  \end{answer}



\question How many of the quadrilaterals possible in the previous problem are:
\begin{multicols}{4}
\begin{parts}
 \part Squares?
 \part Rectangles?
 \part Parallelograms?
 \part Trapezoids?
\end{parts}
\end{multicols}

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{parts}
      \part 5 (you need to skip one dot the top and the bottom). %Squares?
      \part ${7 \choose 2}$ - once you select the two dots on the top, the bottom two are determined. % Rectangles?
      \part This is tricky - you need to worry about running out of space.  One way to count: break into cases by the location of the top left corner.  You get ${7 \choose 2} + ({7 \choose 2}-1) + ({7 \choose 2} - 3) + ({7 \choose 2} - 6) + ({7 \choose 2} - 10) + ({7 \choose 2} - 15)$ %Parallelograms?
      \part All of them %Trapezoids?
    \end{parts}
  \end{answer}




\question On a business retreat, your company of 20 businessmen go golfing.
\begin{parts}
 \part You need to divide up into foursomes (groups of 4 people): a first foursome, a second foursome, and so on.  How many ways can you do this?
 \part After all your hard work, you realize that in fact, you want each foursome to include one of the five CEO's.  How many ways can you do this?
\end{parts}

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{parts}
      \part ${20 \choose 4}{16 \choose 4}{12 \choose 4}{8 \choose 4}{4 \choose 4}$ %You need to divide up into foursomes (groups of 4 people): a first foursome, a second foursome, and so on.  How many ways can you do this?
      \part $5!{15 \choose 3}{12 \choose 3}{9 \choose 3}{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 3}$ %After all your hard work, you realize that in fact, you want each foursome to include one of the five CEO's.  How many ways can you do this?
    \end{parts}
  \end{answer}



\question How many different seating arrangements are possible for King Arthur and his 9 knights around their round table?

  \begin{answer}
     $9!$ (there are 10 people seated around the table, but it does not matter where King Arthur sits, only who sits to his left, two seats to his left, and so on).
  \end{answer}
