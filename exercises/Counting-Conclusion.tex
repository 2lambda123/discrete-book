\question You have 9 presents to give to your 4 kids.  How many ways can this be done if
\begin{parts}
  \part The presents are identical, and each kid gets at least one present?
  \part The presents are identical, and some kids might get no presents?
  \part The presents are unique, and some kids might get no presents?
  \part the presents are unique and each kid gets at least one present?
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
	\begin{parts}
	  \part ${8 \choose 3}$, after giving one present to each kid, you are left with 5 presents (stars) which need to be divide among the 4 kids (giving 3 bars). %The presents are identical, and each kid gets at least one present?
	  \part ${12 \choose 3}$.  You have 9 stars and 3 bars.  %The presents are identical, and some kids might get no presents?
	  \part $4^9$.  You have 4 choices for whom to give each present.  This is like making a function from the set of present to the set of kids. %The presents are unique, and some kids might get no presents?
	  \part $4^9 - \left[{4 \choose 1}3^9 - {4\choose 2}2^9 + {4 \choose 3}1^9 \right]$.  Now the function from the set of present to the set of kids must be surjective. %the presents are unique and each kid gets at least one present?

\question For each of the following counting problems, say whether the answer is


\begin{itemize}
\begin{multicols}{3}
  \item[A] ${10\choose 4}$
  \item[B] $P(10,4)$
  \item[C] Neither
  \end{multicols}
\end{itemize}

If you answer is ``Neither,'' say what the answer should be instead.

  \part Out of a group of 10 classmates, how many ways can you rank your top 4 friends?
  \part If 10 students come to their professor's office but only 4 can fit at a time, how different combinations of 4 students can see the prof first?
  \part How many 4 letter words can be made from the first 10 letters of the alphabet?
  \part How many ways can you make the word ``cake'' from the first 10 letters of the alphabet?
  \part How many ways are there to distribute 10 apples among 4 children?
  \part If you have 10 kids (and live in a shoe) and 4 types of cereal, how many ways can your kids eat breakfast?
  \part How many ways can you arrange exactly 4 ones in a string of 10 binary digits?
  \part You want to select 4 single digit numbers as your lotto picks.  How many choices do you have?
  \part 10 kids want ice-cream.  You have 4 varieties.  How many ways are there to give the kids as much ice-cream as they want?
  \part How many 1-1 functions are there from $\{1,2,\ldots, 10\}$ to $\{a,b,c,d\}$?
  \part How many surjective functions are there from $\{1,2,\ldots, 10\}$ to $\{a,b,c,d\}$?
  \part Each of your 10 bow ties match 4 pairs of suspenders.  How many outfits can you make?
  \part After the party, the 10 kids each choose one of 4 party-favors.  How many outcomes?
  \part How many 6-elements subsets are there of the set $\{1,2,\ldots, 10\}$
  \part How many ways can you split up 11 kids into 5 teams?
  \part How many solutions are there to $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_5 = 6$ where each $x_i$ is non-negative?
  \part Your band goes on tour.  There are 10 cities within driving distance, but only enough time to play 4 of them.  How many choices do you have for the cities on your tour?
  \part In how many different ways can you play the 4 cities you choose?
  \part Out of the 10 breakfast cereals available, you want to have 4 bowls.  How many ways can you do this?
  \part There are 10 types of cookies available.  You want to make a 4 cookie stack.  How many different stacks can you make?
  \part From you home at (0,0) you want to go to either the donut shop at (5,4) or the one at (3,6).  How many paths could you take?
  \part How many 10-digit numbers do not contain a sub-string of 4 repeated digits?
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
	\begin{parts}
	    \part Neither.  ${14 \choose 4}$.
	  \part ${10\choose 4}$
	  \part $P(10,4)$, since order is important.
	  \part Neither. Assuming you will wear each of the 4 ties on just 4 of the 7 days, without repeats: ${10\choose 4}P(7,4)$.
	  \part $P(10,4)$
	  \part ${10\choose 4}$
	  \part Neither. Since you could repeat letters: $10^4$. If no repeats are allowed, it would be $P(10,4)$.
	  \part Neither.  Actually, ``k'' is the 11th letter of the alphabet, so the answer is 0.  If ``k'' was among the first 10 letters, there would only be 1 way - write it down.
	  \part Neither.  Either ${9\choose 3}$ (if every kid gets an apple) or ${13 \choose 3}$ (if appleless kids are allowed).
	  \part Neither.  Note that this could not be ${10 \choose 4}$ since the 10 things and 4 things are from different groups.  $4^{10}$
	  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ - don't be fooled by the ``arrange'' in there - you are picking 4 out of 10 {\em spots} to put the 1's. 
	  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ (assuming order is irrelevant). 
	  \part Neither.  $16^{10}$ (each kid chooses yes or no to 4 varieties).
	  \part Neither.  0.
	  \part Neither.  $4^{10} - [{4\choose 1}3^{10} - {4\choose 2}2^{10} + {4 \choose 3}1^{10}]$
	  \part Neither.  $10\cdot 4$.
	  \part Neither. $4^{10}$.
	  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ (which is the same as ${10 \choose 6}$).
	  \part Neither.  If all the kids were identical, and you wanted no empty teams, it would be ${10 \choose 4}$.  Instead, this will be the same as the number of surjective functions from a set of size 11 to a set of size 5. 
	  \part ${10 \choose 4}$
	  \part ${10 \choose 4}$
	  \part Neither.  $4!$.
	  \part Neither.  It's ${10 \choose 4}$ if you won't repeat any choices.  If repetition is allowed, then this becomes $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots +x_{10} = 4$, which has ${13 \choose 9}$ solutions in non-negative integers.
	  \part Neither.  Since repetition of cookie type is allowed, the answer is $10^4$.  Without repetition, you would have $P(10,4)$.
	  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ since that is equal to ${9 \choose 4} + {9 \choose 3}$.
	  \part Neither.  It will be a complicated (possibly PIE) counting problem.
