\question After gym class you are tasked with putting the 14 identical dodge-balls away into 5 bins.  
\begin{parts}
  \part How many ways can you do this if there are no restrictions?
  \part How many ways can you do this if each bin must contain at least one dodge-ball?
  \part How many ways can you do this if no bin can hold more than 6 balls?
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
	 \begin{parts}
	   \part ${18 \choose 4}$.  Each outcome can be represented by a sequence of 14 stars and 4 bars. %How many ways can you do this if there are no restrictions?
	   \part ${13 \choose 4}$.  First put one ball in each bin.  This leaves 9 stars and 4 bars.%How many ways can you do this if each bin must contain at least one dodge-ball?
	   \part ${18 \choose 4} - \left[ {5 \choose 1}{11 \choose 4} - {5 \choose 2}{4 \choose 4}\right]$.  Subtract all the distributions for which one or more bins contain 7 or more balls.  %How many ways can you do this if no bin can hold more than 6 balls?

\question How many integer solutions are there to the equation $x + y + z = 8$
for which
\begin{parts}
  \part $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all positive?
  \part $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all non-negative?
  \part $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all greater than $-3$.
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
	\begin{parts}
	  \part ${7 \choose 2}$.  After each variable gets 1 star for free, we are left with 5 stars and 2 bars.  %$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all positive?
	  \part ${10 \choose 2}$.  We have 8 stars and 2 bars.  %$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all non-negative?
	  \part ${19 \choose 2}$.  This problem is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to $x' + y' + z' = 17$ where $x'$, $y'$ and $z'$ are non-negative.  (In fact, we really just do a substitution.  Let $x = x'- 3$, $y = y' - 3$ and $z = z' - 3$).  %$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all greater than $-3$.
	\end{parts}

\question When playing Yahtzee, you roll five regular 6-sided dice.  How many different outcomes are possible from a single roll?  The order of the dice does not matter.

	\begin{answer}
	${10 \choose 5}$.  We have 5 stars (the five dice) and 5 bars (the five switches between the number 1-6).
	\end{answer}
	
	


\question How many integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4  = 25$ are there fore which $x_1 \ge 1$, $x_2 \ge 2$, $x_3 \ge 3$  and $x_4 \ge 4$?

	\begin{answer}
	${18 \choose 3}$.  Distribute 10 units to the variables before finding all solutions to $x_1' + x_2' + x_3' + x_4' = 15$ in non-negative integers.
	\end{answer}
