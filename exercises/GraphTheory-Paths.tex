\question You and your friends want to tour the southwest by car.  You will visit the nine states below, with the following rather odd rule: you must cross each border between neighboring states exactly once (so, for example, you must cross the Colorado-Utah border exactly once).  Can you do it?  If so, does it matter where you start your road trip?  What fact about graph theory solves this problem?

	\begin{answer}
		This is a question about finding Euler paths.  Draw a graph with a vertex in each state, and connect vertices if their states share a border.  Exactly two vertices will have odd degree - the vertices for Nevada and Utah.  Thus you must start your road trip at in one of those states and end it in the other. %You and your friends want to tour the southwest by car.

\question Which of the following graphs contain an Euler path?  Which contain an Euler circuit?
\begin{parts}
  \part $K_4$
  \part $K_5$.
  \part $K_{5,7}$
  \part $K_{2,7}$
  \part $C_7$
  \part $P_7$
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
		\begin{parts}
		  \part $K_4$ does not have an Euler path or circuit.
		  \part $K_5$ has an Euler circuit (so also an Euler path).
		  \part $K_{5,7}$ does not have an Euler path or circuit.
		  \part $K_{2,7}$ has an Euler path but not an Euler circuit.
		  \part $C_7$ has an Euler circuit (it is a circuit graph!)
		  \part $P_7$ has an Euler path but no Euler circuit.

\question For which $n$ does the graph $K_n$ contain an Euler circuit?  Explain.

	\begin{answer}
		When $n$ is odd, $K_n$ contains an Euler circuit.  This is because every vertex has degree $n-1$, so an odd $n$ results in all degrees being even.%For which $n$ does the graph $K_n$ contain an Euler circuit?  Explain.

\question For which $m$ and $n$ does the graph $K_{m,n}$ contain an Euler path?  An Euler circuit?  Explain.

	\begin{answer}
		If both $m$ and $n$ are even, then $K_{m,n}$ has an Euler circuit.  When both are odd, there is no Euler path or circuit.  If one is 2 and the other is odd, then there is an Euler path but not an Euler circuit. %For which $m$ and $n$ does the graph $K_{m,n}$ contain an Euler path?  An Euler circuit?  Explain
