\question Is it possible for a planar graph to have 6 vertices, 10 edges and 5 faces?  Explain.

	\begin{answer}
		No.  A (connected) planar graph must satisfy Euler's formula: $V - E + F = 2$.  Here $V - E + F = 6 - 10 + 5 = 1$. %Is it possible for a planar graph to have 6 vertices, 10 edges and 5 faces?  Explain.

\question The graph $G$ has 6 vertices with degrees $2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5$.  How many edges does $G$ have?  Could $G$ be planar?  If so, how many faces would it have.

	\begin{answer}
		$G$ has 10 edges.  It could be planar, and then it would have 6 faces. %The graph $G$ has 6 vertices with degrees $2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5$.  How many edges does $G$ have?  Could $G$ be planar?  If so, how many faces would it have.

\question If a graph has 10 vertices and 10 edges and contains an Euler circuit, must it be planar?  How many faces would it have?

	\begin{answer}
		Yes.  According to Euler's formula it would have 2 faces.  It does.  The only such graph is $C_{10}$. %If a graph has 10 vertices and 10 edges and contains an Euler circuit, must it be planar?  How many faces would it have?
