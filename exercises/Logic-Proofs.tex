   \begin{answer}
     \begin{parts}
 	\part For all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ or $b$ are not even, then $a+b$ is not even.
 	\part For all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ and $b$ are even, then $a+b$ is even.
 	\part There are numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a+b$ is even but $a$ and $b$ are not both even.
 	\part False.  For example, $a = 3$ and $b = 5$.  $a+b = 8$, but neither $a$ nor $b$ are even.
 	\part False, since it is equivalent to the original statement.
 	\part True.  Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.  Assume both are even.  Then $a = 2k$ and $b = 2j$ for some integers $k$ and $j$.  But then $a+b = 2k + 2j = 2(k+j)$ which is even.
 	\part True, since the statement is false.

 \question Prove that $\sqrt 3$ is irrational.
 
   \begin{answer}
     \begin{proof}
      Suppose $\sqrt{3}$ were rational.  Then $\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$ for some integers $a$ and $b \ne 0$.  Without loss of generality, assume $\frac{a}{b}$ is reduced.  Now
 \[3 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\]
 \[b^2 3 = a^2\]
 So $a^2$ is a multiple of 3.  This can only happen if $a$ is a multiple of 3, so $a = 3k$ for some integer $k$.  Then we have
 \[b^2 3 = 9k^2\]
 \[b^2 = 3k^2\]
 So $b^2$ is a multiple of 3, making $b$ a multiple of 3 as well.  But this contradicts our assumption that $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest terms.
     \end{proof}
