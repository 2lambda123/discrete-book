\begin{document}
\noindent \textbf{Instructions}: The problems below are purely for you to practice.  I will not collect these, but it is still a good idea to write out your solutions in full.  Any of these problems or problems similar are fair game for quizzes and exams.  

\begin{questions}
\question Make a truth table for the statement $(P \vee Q) \imp (P \and Q)$. 

\question Make a truth table for the statement $\neg P \wedge (Q \Rightarrow P)$.  What can you conclude about $P$ and $Q$ if you know the statement is true?

\question Make a truth table for the statement $\neg P \imp (Q \and R)$.

\question Determine whether the following two statements are logically equivalent: $\neg(P \imp Q)$ and $P \and \neg Q$.  Explain how you know you are correct.

\question Are the statements $P \imp (Q\vee R)$ and $(P \imp Q) \vee (P \imp R)$ logically equivalent?

\question Consider the statement about a party, ``If it's your birthday or there will be cake, then there will be cake.''
\begin{parts}
 \part Translate the above statement into symbols.  Clearly state which statement is $P$ and which is $Q$.
 \part Make a truth table for the statement.
 \part Assuming the statement is true, what (if anything) can you conclude if there will be cake?
 \part Assuming the statement is true, what (if anything) can you conclude if there will not be cake?
 \part Suppose you found out that the statement was a lie.  What can you conclude?
\end{parts}

\question Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are the statements:
$P$: Jack passed math.
$Q$: Jill passed math.
\begin{parts}
 \part Translate ``Jack and Jill both passed math'' into symbols.
\part Translate ``If Jack passed math, then Jill did not'' into symbols.
\part Translate ``$P \vee Q$'' into English.
\part Translate ``$\neg(P \and Q) \imp Q$'' into English.
\part Suppose you know that if Jack passed math, then so did Jill.  What can you conclude if you know that:
\begin{subparts}
 \subpart Jill passed math?  
\subpart  Jill did not pass math?
\end{subparts}
\end{parts}


\question Geoff Poshingten is out at a fancy pizza joint, and decides to order a calzone.  When the waiter asks what he would like in it, he replies, ``I want either pepperoni or sausage, and if I have sausage, I must also include quail.  Oh, and if I have pepperoni or quail then I must also have ricotta cheese.''  
\begin{parts}
	\part Translate Geoff's order into logical symbols.
	\part The waiter knows that Geoff is either a liar or a truth-teller (so either everything he says is false, or everything is true).  Which is it?
	\part What, if anything, can the waiter conclude about the ingredients in Geoff's desired calzone?
\end{parts}


\question Consider the statement ``If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk.''
\begin{parts}
 \part Write the converse of the statement.
 \part Write the contrapositive of the statement.
 \part Is it possible for the contrapositive to be false?  If it was, what would that tell you?
 \part Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar drinks milk.  Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)?  Explain.
 \part Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar does not drink milk.  Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)?  Explain.
\end{parts}


\question Simplify the following statements (so that negation only appears right before variables).
\begin{parts}
  \part $\neg(P \imp \neg Q)$
  \part $(\neg P \vee \neg Q) \imp \neg (\neg Q \and R)$
  \part $\neg((P \imp \neg Q) \vee \neg (R \and \neg R)$
  \part It is false that if Sam is not a man then Chris is a woman, and that Chris is not a woman.
\end{parts}

\question Translate into symbols.  Use $E(x)$ for ``$x$ is even'' and $O(x)$ for ``$x$ is odd.''
 \begin{parts}
  \part No number is both even and odd.
\part One more than any even number is an odd number.
\part There is prime number that is even.
\part Between any two numbers there is a third number.
\part There is no number between a number and one more than that number.
 \end{parts}

\question Translate into English:
\begin{parts}
 \part $\forall x (E(x) \imp E(x +2))$
\part $\forall x \exists y (\sin(x) = y)$
\part $\forall y \exists x (\sin(x) = y)$
\part $\forall x \forall y (x^3 = y^3 \imp x = y)$
\end{parts}

\question Simplify the statements (so negation appears only directly next to predicates).
\begin{parts}
  \part $\neg \exists x \forall y (\neg O(x) \vee E(y))$
  \part $\neg \forall x \neg \forall y \neg(x < y \and \exists z (x < z \vee y < z))$
  \part There is a number $n$ for which no other number is either less $n$ than or equal to $n$.
  \part It is false that for every number $n$ there are two other numbers which $n$ is between.
\end{parts}


\question Consider the statement ``for all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a + b$ is even, then $a$ and $b$ are even''
\begin{parts}
 \part Write the contrapositive of the statement
 \part Write the converse of the statement
 \part Write the negation of the statement.
 \part Is the original statement true or false?  Prove your answer.
 \part Is the contrapositive of the original statement true or false?  Prove your answer.
 \part Is the converse of the original statement true or false?  Prove your answer.
 \part Is the negation of the original statement true or false?  Prove your answer.
\end{parts}


\question Prove that $\sqrt 3$ is irrational.
