\begin{document}
\noindent \textbf{Instructions}: The problems below are purely for you to practice.  I will not collect these, but it is still a good idea to write out your solutions in full.  Any of these problems or problems similar are fair game for quizzes and exams.  

\begin{questions}
\question Let $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, $B = \{3,4,5,6,7\}$ and $C = \{2,3,5\}$.
\begin{parts}
 \part Find $A \cap B$.
 \part Find $A \cup B$.
 \part Find $A \setminus B$.
 \part Is $C \subseteq A$?
 \part Is $C \subseteq B$?
\end{parts}

\question Draw a Venn diagram to represent each of the following:
\begin{parts}
 \part $A \cup \bar B$
 \part $\bar(A \cup B)$
 \part $A \cap (B \cup C)$
 \part $(A \cap B) \cup C$
 \part $\bar A \cap B \cap \bar C$
\end{parts}

\question Describe the set which has the following Venn diagram:



\question Find an example of sets $A$ and $B$ such that $|A| = 4$, $|B| = 5$ and $|A \cup B| = 9$.  

\question Find an example of sets $A$ and $B$ such that $|A| = 3$, $|B| = 4$ and $|A \cup B| = 5$.

\question If $|A| = 10$ and $|B| = 15$, what is the largest possible value for $|A \cap B|$?  What is the smallest?  What are the possible values for $|A \cup B|$?

\question If $|A| = 8$ and $|B| = 5$, what is $|A \cup B| + |A \cap B|$?

\question In a regular deck of playing cards there are 26 red cards and 12 face cards.  Explain in terms of sets why there are only 6 red face cards.

\question A group of college students were asked about their TV watching habits.  Of those surveyed, 28 students watch {\em House}, 19 watch {\em Castle} and 24 watch re-runs of {\em 24}.  Additionally, 16 watch {\em House} and {\em Castle}, 14 watch {\em House} and {\em 24} and 10 watch {\em Castle} and {\em 24}.  There are 8 students who watch all three shows.  How many students surveyed watched at least one of the shows?
