\begin{questions}
\question % Find the closed formula for each of the following sequences by relating them to a well know sequence.  Assume the first term given is $a_1$.
\begin{parts}
%$2, 5, 10, 17, 26, \ldots$
  \part $a_n = n^2 + 1$
%   $0, 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, \ldots$
  \part $a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1$
%   $8, 12, 17, 23, 30,\ldots$
  \part $a_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2} + 2$
%   $1, 5, 23, 119, 719,\ldots$
  \part $a_n = (n+1)! - 1$ (where $n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots n$)
\end{parts}

\question %The Fibonacci sequence is $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots$ (where $F_0 = 0$).
\begin{parts}
%Give the recursive definition for the sequence.
  \part $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$.
%   Write out the first few terms of the sequence of partial sums. 
  \part  $0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, \ldots$
  %Give a closed formula for the sequence of partial sums in terms of $F_n$  (for example, you might say $F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_n = 3F_{n-1}^2 + n$, although that is definitely not correct).
  \part $F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1$ 
\end{parts}

%Write out the first few terms of the sequence given by $a_1 = 3$; $a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 4$.  Then find a recursive formula for the sequence $10, 24, 52, 108, \ldots$.
\question $3, 10, 24, 52, 108,\ldots$.  The recursive definition for $10, 24, 52, \ldots$ is $a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 4$ with $a_1 = 10$.

% Write out the first few terms of the sequence given by $a_n = n^2 - 3n + 1$.  Then find a closed formula for the sequence (starting with $a_1$) $0, 2, 6, 12, 20, \ldots$.
\question $-1, -1, 1, 5, 11, 19,\ldots$  Thus the sequence $0, 2, 6, 12, 20,\ldots$ has closed formula $a_n = (n+1)^2 - 3(n+1) + 2$.

\question $\frac{1 + \frac{2^{31}}{3^{31}}}{5/3}$

% Find $x$ and $y$ such that $27, x, y, 1$ is part of an arithmetic progression.  Then find $x$ and $y$ so that the sequence is part of a geometric progression.  ($x$ and $y$ might not be integers.) 
\question For arithmetic: $x = 55/3$, $y = 29/3$.  For geometric: $x = 9$ and $y = 3$.

\begin{parts}
  \part $\d\sum_{k=1}^n 2k$		%$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + \cdots + 2n$
  \part $\d\sum_{k=1}^{107} (1 + 4(k-1))$		%$1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + \cdots + 425$
  \part $\d\sum_{k=1}^{50} \frac{1}{k}$		%$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{50}$
  \part $\d\prod_{k=1}^n 2k$		%$2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot \cdots \cdot 2n$
  \part $\d\prod_{k=1}^{100} \frac{k}{k+1}$	%$(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{2}{3})(\frac{3}{4})\cdots(\frac{100}{101})$
\end{parts}

  \part $\d\prod_{k=2}^{100}\frac{k^2}{(k^2-1} = \frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{9}{8}\cdot\frac{16}{15}\cdots\frac{10000}{9999}$
  \part $\d\prod_{k=0}^n (2+3k) = (2)(5)(8)(11)(14)\cdots(2+3n)$

% \question Use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the $n$th term of the following sequences:
% \begin{parts}
% \part 2, 5, 11, 21, 36,\ldots
% \part 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, \ldots
% \end{parts}
\question 
\begin{parts}
\part Hint: third differences are constant, so $a_n = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$.  Use the terms of the sequence to solve for $a, b, c,$ and $d$.
\part $a_n = n^2 - n$
\end{parts}

 % Can you use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the $n$th term of the sequence 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, \ldots?  Explain why or why not. 
\question No.  The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence so no differences will be constant.  

% Find the next 2 terms in the sequence $3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85\ldots.$.  Then give a recursive definition for the sequence.  Finally, use the characteristic root technique to find a closed formula for the sequence.
\question 171 and 341.  $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$ with $a_0 = 3$ and $a_1 = 5$.  Closed formula: $a_n = \frac{8}{3}2^n + \frac{1}{3}(-1)^n$

% Solve the recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^n$ with $a_0 = 5$.
\question By telescoping or iteration.  $a_n = 3 + 2^{n+1}$

% Show that $4^n$ is a solution to the recurrence relation $a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}$.
\question We claim $a_n = 4^n$ works.  Plug it in: $4^n = 3(4^{n-1}) + 4(4^{n-2})$.  This works - just simplify the right hand side.

% Find the solution to the recurrence relation $a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}$ with initial terms $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 3$.
\question By the Characteristic Root Technique.  $a_n = 4^n + (-1)^n$.

% Find the solution to the recurrence relation $a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}$ with initial terms $a_0 = 5$ and $a_1 = 8$.
\question $a_n = \frac{13}{5} 4^n + \frac{12}{5} (-1)^n$


\question The general solution is $a_n = a + bn$ where $a$ and $b$ depend on the initial conditions.  %Solve the recurrence relation $a_n = 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}$.
\begin{parts}
  \part $a_n = 1 + n$
  %What is the solution if the initial terms are $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 2$?
  \part For example, we could have $a_0 = 21$ and $a_1 = 22$.  %What do the initial terms need to be in order for $a_9 = 30$?
  \part For every $x$ - take $a_0 = x-9$ and $a_1 = x-8$.  %For which $x$ are there initial terms which make $a_9 = x$?
\end{parts}

\question Solve the recurrence relation $a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 10a_{n-2}$ with initial terms $a_0 = 4$ and $a_1 = 1$.
