\begin{questions}
% Use induction to prove for all $n \in \N$ that $\d\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1$.
\question 
\begin{proof}
 We must prove that $1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$ for all $n \in \N$.  Thus let $P(n)$ be the statement $1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$.  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
 
 First we establish the base case, $P(0)$, which claims that $1 = 2^{0+1} -1$.  Since $2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$, we see that $P(0)$ is true.
 
 Now for the inductive case.  Assume that $P(k)$ is true for an arbitrary $k \in \N$.  That is, $1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1$.  We must show that $P(k+1)$ is true (i.e., that $1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1$).  To do this, we start with the left hand side of $P(k+1)$ and work to the right hand side:
 \begin{align*}
  1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = &~ 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} & \mbox{ \footnotesize by the inductive hypothesis}\\
   = & ~2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 & \\
   = &~ 2^{k+2} - 1 &
 \end{align*}
Thus $P(k+1)$ is true so by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
\end{proof}

% Prove that $7^n - 1$ is a multiple of 6 for all $n \in \N$
\question 
\begin{proof}
 Let $P(n)$ be the statement ``$7^n - 1$ is a multiple of 6.''  We will show $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  
 
 First we establish the base case, $P(0)$.  Since $7^0 - 1 = 0$, and $0$ is a multiple of 6, $P(0)$ is true.
 
 Now for the inductive case.  Assume $P(k)$ holds for an arbitrary $k \in \N$.  That is, $7^k - 1$ is a multiple of 6, or in other words, $7^k - 1 = 6j$ for some integer $j$.  Now consider $7^{k+1} - 1$:
 \begin{align*}
  7^{k+1} - 1 ~ & = 7^{k+1} - 7 + 6 & \mbox{ \footnotesize by cleverness: $-1 = -7 + 6$}\\
  & = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 & \mbox{ \footnotesize factor out a 7 from the first two terms}\\
  & = 7(6j) + 6 & \mbox{ \footnotesize by the inductive hypothesis}\\
  & = 6(7j + 1) & \mbox{ \footnotesize factor out a 6}
 \end{align*}
Therefore $7^{k+1} - 1$ is a multiple of 6, or in other words, $P(k+1)$ is true.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
\end{proof}

% Prove that $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2$ for all $n \ge 1$.
\question 
\begin{proof}
 Let $P(n)$ be the statement $1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2$.  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 1$.  
 
 First the base case, $P(1)$.  We have $ 1 = 1^2$ which is true, so $P(1)$ is established.
 
 Now the inductive case.  Assume that $P(k)$ is true for some fixed arbitrary $k \ge 1$.  That is, $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2$.  We will now prove that $P(k+1)$ is also true (i.e., that $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2$).  We start with the left hand side of $P(k+1)$ and work to the right hand side:
 \begin{align*}
  1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2k+1) ~ & = k^2 + (2k+1) & \mbox{ \footnotesize by the induction hypothesis}\\
  & = (k+1)^2 & \mbox{ \footnotesize by factoring}
 \end{align*}
Thus $P(k+1)$ holds, so by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 1$.
\end{proof}

% Prove that $F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1$ where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number.
\question 
\begin{proof}
 Let $P(n)$ be the statement $F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1$.  We will show that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 0$.  First the base case is easy because $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$ so $F_0 = F_1 - 1$.  Now consider the inductive case.  Assume $P(k)$ is true, that is, assume $F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k} = F_{2k+1} - 1$.  To establish $P(k+1)$ we work from left to right:
 \begin{align*}
  F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k} + F_{2k+2} ~ & = F_{2k+1} - 1 + F_{2k+2} & \mbox{\footnotesize by the inductive hypothesis}\\
  & = F_{2k+1} + F_{2k+2} - 1 & \\
  & = F_{2k+3} - 1 & \mbox{\footnotesize by the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers}
 \end{align*}
Therefore $F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k+2} = F_{2k+3} - 1$, which is to say $P(k+1)$ holds.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 0$.
\end{proof}


% Prove that $2^n < n!$ for all $n \ge 4$.  (Recall, $n! = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots\cdot n$.)
\question 
\begin{proof}
 Let $P(n)$ be the statement $2^n < n!$.  We will show $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 4$.  First, we check the base case and see that yes, $2^4 < 4!$ (as $16 < 24$) so $P(4)$ is true.  Now for the inductive case.  Assume $P(k)$ is true for an arbitrary $k \ge 4$.  That is, $2^k < k!$.  Now consider $P(k+1)$: $2^{k+1} < (k+1)!$.  To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.
 \begin{align*}
  2^{k+1}~ & = 2\cdot 2^k & \\
  & < 2\cdot k! & \mbox{ \footnotesize by the inductive hypothesis}\\
  & < (k+1) \cdot k! & \mbox{ \footnotesize since $k+1 > 2$}\\
  & = (k+1)! &
 \end{align*}
Therefore $2^{k+1} < (k+1)!$ so we have established $P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 4$.
\end{proof}

% What is wrong with the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that $n+3 = n+7$ for all values of $n$ (besides of course that the thing it is claiming to prove is false)? 
%   \begin{proof}
%     Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $n + 3 = n + 7$.  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  Assume, for induction that $P(k)$ is true.  That is, $k+3 = k+7$.  We must show that $P(k+1)$ is true.  Now since $k + 3 = k + 7$, add 1 to both sides.  This gives $k + 3 + 1 = k + 7 + 1$.  Regrouping $(k+1) + 3 = (k+1) + 7$.  But this is simply $P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
%   \end{proof}
\question The only problem is that we never established the base case.  Of course, when $n = 0$, $0+3 \ne 0+7$.

% The proof in the previous problem does not work.  But if we modify the ``fact,'' we can get a working proof.  Prove that $n + 3 < n + 7$ for all values of $n \in \N$.  You can do this proof with algebra (without induction) the goal of this exercise is to write out a valid induction proof.
\question 
\begin{proof}
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $n + 3 < n + 7$.  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  First, note that the base case holds: $0+3 < 0+7$.  Now assume for induction that $P(k)$ is true.  That is, $k+3 < k+7$.  We must show that $P(k+1)$ is true.  Now since $k + 3 < k + 7$, add 1 to both sides.  This gives $k + 3 + 1 < k + 7 + 1$.  Regrouping $(k+1) + 3 < (k+1) + 7$.  But this is simply $P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
\end{proof}

%   Find the flaw in the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that $n < 100$ for every $n \in \N$.
%  \begin{proof}
%   Let $P(n)$ be the statement $n < 100$.  We will prove $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$. First we establish the base case: when $n = 0$, $P(n)$ is true, because $0 < 100$.  Now for the inductive step, assume $P(k)$ is true.  That is, $k < 100$.  Now if $k < 100$, then $k$ is some number, like 80.  Of course $80+1 = 81$ which is still less than 100.  So $k +1 < 100$ as well.  But this is what $P(k+1)$ claims, so we have shown that $P(k) \imp P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
%  \end{proof}
\question  The problem here is that while $P(0)$ is true, and while $P(k) \imp P(k+1)$ for {\em some} values of $k$, there is at least one value of $k$ (namely $k = 99$) when that implication fails.  For a valid proof by induction, $P(k) \imp P(k+1)$ must be true for all values of $k$ greater than or equal to the base case.

% While the above proof does not work (it better not - the statement it is trying to prove is false!)  we can prove something similar.  Prove that there is a strictly increasing sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ of numbers (not necessarily integers) such that $a_n < 100$ for all $n \in \N$.  (By {\em strictly increasing} we mean $a_n < a_{n+1}$ for all $n$ - so each term must be larger than the last.)
\question 
\begin{proof}
First let us say what the sequence is, then we will prove that the sequence is increasing and that each term in the sequence is less than 100 by induction.  We define the sequence recursively.  Let $a_n = a_{n-1} + \frac{100 - a_{n-1}}{2}$ with initial condition $a_0 = 50$
 Let $P(n)$ be the statement $a_n < a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+1} < 100$.  We will prove $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$. First we establish the base case: when $n = 0$, $P(n)$ is true, because $a_0 = 50$ and $a_1 = 75$, so $a_0 < a_1$ and $a_1 < 100$.  Now for the inductive step, assume $P(k)$ is true.  That is, $a_k < a_{k+1}$ and $a_{k+1} < 100$.    What can we say about $a_{k+2}$?  Well since $a_{k+1}< 100$, we know that $100 - a{k+1}$ is positive, so $a_{k+1} < a_{k+2}$.  But also, we have increased by only half the distance to 100, so $a_{k+2} < 100$ as well.  But this is what $P(k+1)$ claims, so we have shown that $P(k) \imp P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
\end{proof}


% What is wrong with the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that for all $n \in \N$, the number $n^2 + n$ is odd?
%   \begin{proof}
%     Let $P(n)$ be the statement ``$n^2 + n$ is odd.''  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  Suppose for induction that $P(k)$ is true, that is, that $k^2 + k$ is odd.  Now consider the statement $P(k+1)$.  Now $(k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2$.  By the inductive hypothesis, $k^2 + k$ is odd, and of course $2k + 2$ is even.  An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore $(k+1)^2 + (k+1)$ is odd.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
%   \end{proof}
\question We once again failed to establish the base case: when $n = 0$, $n^2 + n = 0$ which is even, not odd.

% Now give a valid proof (by induction - even though you might be able to do so without using induction) of the statement, ``for all $n \in \N$, the number $n^2 + n$ is even.'
\question 
  \begin{proof}
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement ``$n^2 + n$ is even.''  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  First the base case: when $n = 0$, we have $n^2 + n = 0$ which is even, so $P(0)$ is true.  Now suppose for induction that $P(k)$ is true, that is, that $k^2 + k$ is even.  Now consider the statement $P(k+1)$.  Now $(k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2$.  By the inductive hypothesis, $k^2 + k$ is even, and of course $2k + 2$ is even.  An even plus an even is always even, so therefore $(k+1)^2 + (k+1)$ is even.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
  \end{proof}
  
% Prove that there is a sequence of positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ such that the partial sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n$ is strictly less than $2$ for all $n \in \N$.  This is a bit tricky - think about how you could define what $a_{k+1}$ is to make the induction argument work.
\question Hint: the idea is to define the sequence so that $a_n$ is less than the distance between the previous partial sum and 2.  That way when you add it into the next partial sum, the partial sum is still less than 2.  You could do this ahead of time, or use a clever $P(n)$ in the induction proof.  Let $P(n)$ be the statement, ``there is a sequence of positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n < 2$.''  The base case should be easy (just pick $a_1 < 2$).  For the inductive case, you know that $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k < 2$ so you just need to argue that you can find some $a_{k+1}$ sm
