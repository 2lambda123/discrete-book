\firstpageheader{Math 228}{\bf Practice Problems 5: Induction}{Spring 2012}


\begin{document}
\noindent \textbf{Instructions}: The problems below are purely for you to practice.  I will not collect these, but it is still a good idea to write out your solutions in full.  Any of these problems or problems similar are fair game for quizzes and exams.  

\begin{questions}
\question Use induction to prove for all $n \in \N$ that $\d\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1$.
\question Prove that $7^n - 1$ is a multiple of 6 for all $n \in \N$.
\question Prove that $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2$ for all $n \ge 1$.
\question Prove that $F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1$ where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number.
\question Prove that $2^n < n!$ for all $n \ge 4$.  (Recall, $n! = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots\cdot n$.)

\question What is wrong with the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that $n+3 = n+7$ for all values of $n$ (besides of course that the thing it is claiming to prove is false)? 
  \begin{proof}
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $n + 3 = n + 7$.  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  Assume, for induction that $P(k)$ is true.  That is, $k+3 = k+7$.  We must show that $P(k+1)$ is true.  Now since $k + 3 = k + 7$, add 1 to both sides.  This gives $k + 3 + 1 = k + 7 + 1$.  Regrouping $(k+1) + 3 = (k+1) + 7$.  But this is simply $P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
  \end{proof}

\question The proof in the previous problem does not work.  But if we modify the ``fact,'' we can get a working proof.  Prove that $n + 3 < n + 7$ for all values of $n \in \N$.  You can do this proof with algebra (without induction) the goal of this exercise is to write out a valid induction proof.
  
\question  Find the flaw in the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that $n < 100$ for every $n \in \N$.
 \begin{proof}
  Let $P(n)$ be the statement $n < 100$.  We will prove $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$. First we establish the base case: when $n = 0$, $P(n)$ is true, because $0 < 100$.  Now for the inductive step, assume $P(k)$ is true.  That is, $k < 100$.  Now if $k < 100$, then $k$ is some number, like 80.  Of course $80+1 = 81$ which is still less than 100.  So $k +1 < 100$ as well.  But this is what $P(k+1)$ claims, so we have shown that $P(k) \imp P(k+1)$.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
 \end{proof}

\question While the above proof does not work (it better not - the statement it is trying to prove is false!)  we can prove something similar.  Prove that there is a strictly increasing sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ of numbers (not necessarily integers) such that $a_n < 100$ for all $n \in \N$.  (By {\em strictly increasing} we mean $a_n < a_{n+1}$ for all $n$ - so each term must be larger than the last.)


\question What is wrong with the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that for all $n \in \N$, the number $n^2 + n$ is odd?
  \begin{proof}
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement ``$n(n+1)$ is odd.''  We will prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.  Suppose for induction that $P(k)$ is true, that is, that $k(k+1)$ is true.  Now consider the statement $P(k+1)$.  Now $(k+1)(k+2) = k(k+1) + 2(k+1)$.  By the inductive hypothesis, $k(k+1)$ is odd, and of course $2(k+1)$ is even.  An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore $(k+1)(k+2)$ is odd.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$.
  \end{proof}

\question Now give a valid proof (by induction - even though you might be able to do so without using induction) of the statement, ``for all $n \in \N$, the number $n^2 + n$ is even.''

\question Prove that there is a sequence of positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ such that the partial sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n$ is strictly less than $2$ for all $n \in \N$.  This is a bit tricky - think about how you could define what $a_{k+1}$ is to make the induction argument work.
