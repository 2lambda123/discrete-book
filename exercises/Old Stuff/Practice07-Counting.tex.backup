\begin{document}
\noindent \textbf{Instructions}: The problems below are purely for you to practice.  I will not collect these, but it is still a good idea to write out your solutions in full.  Any of these problems or problems similar are fair game for quizzes and exams.  

\begin{questions}
\question Your wardrobe consists of 5 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, and 17 bow ties.  How many different outfits can you make?

\question For an interview, you must wear a tie.  You own 3 regular (boring) ties and 5 (cool) bow ties.  How many choices do you have for your neck-wear? 

\question You realize that the interview is for clown-college, so you should probably wear both a regular tie and a bow tie.  How many choices do you have now?

\question You realize that it would also be okay to wear more than two ties.
\begin{parts}
 \part You must select some of your ties to wear - everything is okay, from no ties up to all ties.  How many choices do you have?
 \part If you want to wear at least one regular tie and one bow tie, but are willing to wear up to all your ties, how many choices do you have for which ties to wear?
 \part How many choices do you have if you wear exactly 2 of the 3 regular ties and 3 of the 5 bow ties?
 \part Once you have selected 2 regular and 3 bow ties, in how many orders could you put the ties on, assuming you must have one of the three bow ties on top?
\end{parts}

\question Your Blu-ray collection consists of 9 comedies and 7 horror movies. Give an example of a question for which the answer is:
\begin{parts}
 \part 16.
 \part 63.
\end{parts}

\question Consider all 5 letter ``words'' made from the letters $a$ through $h$.
\begin{parts}
 \part How many of these words are there total?
 \part How many of these words contain no repeated letters?
 \part How many of these words (repetitions allowed) start with the sub-word ``aha''?
 \part How many of these words (repetitions allowed) either start with ``aha'' or end with ``bah'' or both?
 \part How many of the words containing no repeats also do not contain the sub-word ``bad'' (in consecutive letters)?  
\end{parts}

\question How many 10-bit strings contain 6 or more 1's?

\question What is the coefficient of $x^9$ in the expansion of $(x+1)^{14} + x^3(x+2)^{15}$?

\question Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
\begin{parts}
  \part How many subsets are there total? 
  \part How many subsets contain $\{2,3,5\}$ as a subset?
  \part How many subsets of $S$ contain no prime numbers?
  \part How many subsets contain at least one odd number? 
  \part How many doubletons (i.e., subsets of two elements) contain exactly one even number?
\end{parts}
   
\question How many shortest lattice paths start at (0,0) and
\begin{parts}
  \part end at (10,10)?
  \part end at (10,10) and pass through (3,7)?
  \part end at (10,10) and avoid (3,7)?
\end{parts}   
   
\question A pizza parlor offers 10 toppings.
\begin{parts}
 \part How many 3-topping pizzas could they put on their menu?  Assume double toppings are not allowed.
 \part How many total pizzas are possible, with between zero and ten toppings (but not double toppings) allowed?
 \part The pizza parlor will list the 10 toppings in two columns on their menu.  How many ways can they arrange the toppings in the left column?
\end{parts}

\question How many quadrilaterals can you draw using the dots below as vertices (corners)?

\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
  \foreach \x in {-3,...,3}
  \foreach \y in {-1,1}
  \fill (\x,\y) circle (3pt);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\question How many of the quadrilaterals possible in the previous problem are:
\begin{parts}
 \part Squares?
 \part Rectangles?
 \part Parallelograms?
 \part Trapezoids?
\end{parts}


\question On a business retreat, your company of 20 businessmen go golfing.
\begin{parts}
 \part You need to divide up into foursomes (groups of 4 people): a first foursome, a second foursome, and so on.  How many ways can you do this?
 \part After all your hard work, you realize that in fact, you want each foursome to include one of the five CEO's.  How many ways can you do this?
\end{parts}

\end{questions}
