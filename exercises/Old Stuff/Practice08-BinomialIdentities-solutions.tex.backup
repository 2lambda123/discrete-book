%Give a combinatorial proof for the identity $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = {n+1 \choose 2}$. 
\question \begin{proof}
           \underline{Question}: How many subsets of $A = {1,2,3, \ldots, n+1}$ contain exactly two elements?
           
           \underline{Answer 1}: We must choose 2 elements from $n+1$ choices, so there are ${n+1 \choose 2}$ subsets.
           
           \underline{Answer 2}: We break this question down into cases, based on what the larger of the two elements in the subset is. The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.
           
           Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.
           
           Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.
           
           Larger element is 4: there are 3 choices for the smaller element.
           
           And so on.  When the larger element is $n+1$, there are $n$ choices for the smaller element.  Since each two element subset must be in exactly one of these cases, the total number of two element subsets is $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n$.
           
           Answer 1 and answer 2 are both correct, so they must be equal.  Therefore
           \[1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = {n+1 \choose 2}\]
          \end{proof}


\question %A woman is getting married.  She has 15 best friends but can only select 6 of them to be her bride's maids, one of which needs to be her maid of honor.  How many ways can she do this?
\begin{parts}
 \part She has ${15 \choose 6}$ ways to select the 6 bride's maids, and then for each way, has 6 choices for the maid of honor.  Thus she has ${15 \choose 6}6$ choices.  %What if she first selects the 6 bride's maids, and then selects one of them to be the maid of honor?
 \part She has 15 choices for who will be her maid of honor.  Then she needs to select 5 of the remaining 14 friends to be bride's maids, which she can do in ${14 \choose 5}$ ways.  Thus she has $15 {14 \choose 5}$ choices.  %What if she first selects her maid of honor, and then 5 other bride's maids?
 \part We have answered the question (how many wedding parties can the bride choose from) in two ways.  The first way gives the left hand side of the identity and the second way gives the right hand side of the identity.  Therefore the identity holds. %Explain why $6 {15 \choose 6} = 15 {14 \choose 5}$.
\end{parts}

\question %Consider the bit strings in $\b B^6_2$ (bit strings of length 6 and weight 2).
\begin{parts}
 \part After the 1, we need to find a 5-bit string with one 1.  There are ${5 \choose 1}$ ways to do this. %How many of those bit strings start with 1?
 \part ${4 \choose 1}$ (we need to pick 1 of the remaining 4 slots to be the second 1). %How many of those bit strings start with 01?
 \part ${3 \choose 1}$ %How many of those bit strings start with 001?
 \part Yes.  We still need strings starting with 0001 (there are ${2 \choose 1}$ of these) and strings starting 00001 (there is only ${1 \choose 1} = 1$ of these).  %Are there any other strings we have not counted yet?  Which ones, and how many are there?
 \part ${6 \choose 2}$ %How many bit strings are there total in $\b B^6_2$?
 \part An example of the Hockey Stick Theorem:  %What binomial identity have you just given a combinatorial proof for?
 \[{1 \choose 1} + {2 \choose 1} + {3 \choose 1} + {4 \choose 1} + {5 \choose 1} = {6 \choose 2}\]
\end{parts}


\question %Let's count {\em ternary} digit strings - strings in which each digit can be 0, 1, or 2.
\begin{parts}
 \part $3^n$, since there are 3 choices for each of the $n$ digits.  %How many ternary digit strings contain exactly $n$ digits?  
 \part $1$, since all the digits need to be 2's.  However, we might write this as ${n \choose 0}$.  %How many ternary digit strings contain exactly $n$ digits and $n$ 2's.
 \part There are ${n \choose 1}$ places to put the non-2 digit.  That digit can be either a 0 or a 1, so there are $2{n \choose 1}$ such strings.  %How many ternary digit strings contain exactly $n$ digits and $n-1$ 2's.  (Hint: where can you put the non-2 digit, and then what could it be?)
 \part How many ternary digit strings contain exactly $n$ digits and $n-2$ 2's.  (Hint: see previous hint)
 \part How many ternary digit strings contain exactly $n$ digits and $n-k$ 2's.
 \part How many ternary digit strings contain exactly $n$ digits and no 2's. (Hint: what kind of a string is this?)
 \part Use the above parts to give a combinatorial proof for the identity
 \[{n \choose 0} + 2{n \choose 1} + 2^2{n \choose 2} + 2^3{n \choose 3} + \cdots + 2^n{n \choose n} = 3^n\]
\end{parts}
\question Give a combinatorial proof for the identity $P(n,k) = {n \choose k}k!$
