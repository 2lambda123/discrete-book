\begin{questions}
\question %Consider functions $f: \{1,2,3,4\} \to \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$.
\begin{parts}
  \part $6^4 = 1296$, since there are six choices of where to send each of the 4 elements of the domain. %How many functions are there total?
  \part $P(6, 4) = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360$, since outputs cannot be repeated.  %How many functions are one-to-one?
  \part None. %How many functions are onto?
  \part There are $5 \cdot 6^3$ functions for which $f(1) \ne a$ and another $5 \cdot 6^3$ functions for which $f(2) \ne b$.  There are $5^2 \cdot 6^2$ functions for which both $f(1) \ne a$ and $f(2) \ne b$.  So the total number of functions for which $f(1) \ne a$ or $f(2) \ne b$ or both is
  \[5 \cdot 6^3 + 5 \cdot 6^3 - 5^2 \cdot 6^2 = 1260\] %How many functions have the property that $f(1) \ne a$ or $f(2) \ne b$, or both?
\end{parts}

\question %Consider sets $A$ and $B$ with $|A| = 10$ and $|B| = 17$.
\begin{parts}
  \part $17^{10}$ %How many functions $f: A \to B$ are there?
  \part $P(17, 10)$  %How many functions $f: A \to B$ are one-to-one?
\end{parts}

\question $5^{10} - \left[{5 \choose 1}4^{10} - {5 \choose 2}3^{10} + {5 \choose 3}2^{10} - {5 \choose 4}1^{10}\right]$ %Consider sets $A$ and $B$ with $|A| = 10$ and $|B| = 5$.  How many functions $f: A \to B$ are onto?

\question $5! - \left[{5 \choose 1}4! - {5 \choose 2}3! + {5 \choose 3}2! - {5 \choose 4}1! + {5 \choose 5}0!\right]$.  This is a sneaky way to as for the number of derangements on 5 elements. %Let $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$.  How many one-to-one functions $f:A \to A$ have the property that for each $x \in A$, $f(x) \ne x$?

\question ${10 \choose 6}\left(4! - \left[{4 \choose 1} 3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3}1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right]\right)$.  We choose 6 of the 10 ladies to get their own hat, and the multiply by the number of ways the remaining hats can be deranged.   %Ten ladies of a certain age drop off their red hats at the hat check of a museum.  As they are leaving, the hat check attendant gives the hats back randomly.  What is the probability that exactly six of the ladies receive their own hat (and the other four do not)?

\question %After gym class you are tasked with putting the 14 identical dodge-balls away into 5 bins.  
\begin{parts}
  \part ${18 \choose 4}$.  Each outcome can be represented by a sequence of 14 stars and 4 bars. %How many ways can you do this if there are no restrictions?
  \part ${13 \choose 4}$.  First put one ball in each bin.  This leaves 9 stars and 4 bars.%How many ways can you do this if each bin must contain at least one dodge-ball?
  \part ${18 \choose 4} - \left[ {5 \choose 1}{11 \choose 4} - {5 \choose 2}{4 \choose 4}\right]$.  Subtract all the distributions for which one or more bins contain 7 or more balls.  %How many ways can you do this if no bin can hold more than 6 balls?
\end{parts}

\question %How many integer solutions are there to the equation $x + y + z = 8$ for which
\begin{parts}
  \part ${7 \choose 2}$.  After each variable gets 1 star for free, we are left with 5 stars and 2 bars.  %$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all positive?
  \part ${10 \choose 2}$.  We have 8 stars and 2 bars.  %$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all non-negative?
  \part ${19 \choose 2}$.  This problem is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to $x' + y' + z' = 17$ where $x'$, $y'$ and $z'$ are non-negative.  (In fact, we really just do a substitution.  Let $x = x'- 3$, $y = y' - 3$ and $z = z' - 3$).  %$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all greater than $-3$.
\end{parts}

\question ${10 \choose 5}$.  We have 5 stars (the five dice) and 5 bars (the five switches between the number 1-6).   %When playing Yahtzee, you roll five regular 6-sided dice.  How many different outcomes are possible from a single roll?  The order of the dice does not matter.

\question ${18 %How many integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4  = 25$ are there fore which $x_1 \ge 1$, $x_2 \ge 2$, $x_3 \ge 3$  and $x_4 \ge 4$?

\question You have 9 presents to give to your 4 kids.  How many ways can this be done if
\begin{parts}
  \part The presents are identical, and each kid gets at least one present?
  \part The presents are identical, and some kids might get no presents?
  \part The presents are unique, and some kids might get no presents?
  \part the presents are unique and each kid gets at least one present?
\end{parts}

\question 
\begin{parts}
    \part Neither.  ${14 \choose 4}$.
  \part ${10\choose 4}$
  \part $P(10,4)$, since order is important.
  \part Neither. Assuming you will wear each of the 4 ties on just 4 of the 7 days, without repeats: ${10\choose 4}P(7,4)$.
  \part $P(10,4)$
  \part ${10\choose 4}$
  \part Neither. Since you could repeat letters: $10^4$. If no repeats are allowed, it would be $P(10,4)$.
  \part Neither.  Actually, ``k'' is the 11th letter of the alphabet, so the answer is 0.  If ``k'' was among the first 10 letters, there would only be 1 way - write it down.
  \part Neither.  Either ${9\choose 3}$ (if every kid gets an apple) or ${13 \choose 3}$ (if appleless kids are allowed).
  \part Neither.  Note that this could not be ${10 \choose 4}$ since the 10 things and 4 things are from different groups.  $4^{10}$
  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ - don't be fooled by the ``arrange'' in there - you are picking 4 out of 10 {\em spots} to put the 1's. 
  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ (assuming order is irrelevant). 
  \part Neither.  $16^{10}$ (each kid chooses yes or no to 4 varieties).
  \part Neither.  0.
  \part Neither.  $4^{10} - [{4\choose 1}3^{10} - {4\choose 2}2^{10} + {4 \choose 3}1^{10}]$
  \part Neither.  $10\cdot 4$.
  \part Neither. $4^{10}$.
  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ (which is the same as ${10 \choose 6}$).
  \part Neither.  If all the kids were identical, and you wanted no empty teams, it would be ${10 \choose 4}$.  Instead, this will be the same as the number of onto functions from a set of size 11 to a set of size 5. 
  \part ${10 \choose 4}$
  \part ${10 \choose 4}$
  \part Neither.  $4!$.
  \part Neither.  It's ${10 \choose 4}$ if you won't repeat any choices.  If repetition is allowed, then this becomes $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots +x_{10} = 4$, which has ${13 \choose 9}$ solutions in non-negative integers.
  \part Neither.  Since repetition of cookie type is allowed, the answer is $10^4$.  Without repetition, you would have $P(10,4)$.
  \part ${10 \choose 4}$ since that is equal to ${9 \choose 4} + {9 \choose 3}$.
  \part Neither.  It will be a complicated (possibly PIE) counting problem.
