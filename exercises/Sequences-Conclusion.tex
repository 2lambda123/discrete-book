%\question Each day your supply of magic chocolate covered espresso beans doubles (each one splits in half), but then you eat 5 of them.  You have 10 on day 0. 
%
%\begin{parts}
%	\part Write out the first few terms of the sequence.
%	\part Give a recursive definition of the sequence and explain why it is correct.
%	\part Prove, using induction, that the last digit of the number of beans you have on the $n$th day will always be a 5 for all $n \ge 1$.
%	\part Find a closed formula for the $n$th term of the sequence and prove it is correct by induction.
%\end{parts}
%
%	\begin{answer}
%		\begin{parts}
%			\part $10, 15, 25, 45, 85, \ldots$.
%			\part On day $n$, you will have twice the number of beans you had the previous day, less 5.  Thus $a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 5$ with $a_0 = 10$.
%			\part Let $P(n)$ be the statement, ``on day $n$, the number of beans you have ends in a 5.''  For the base case, not that on day 1, you have 15 beans, which ends in a 5.  Now assume that $P(k)$ is true.  That is, on the $k$th day, the number of beans ends in a 5.  What happens on the next day?  We double the number of beans, and subtract 5.  If you double a number ending in 5, you will get a number ending in a 0.  Then subtracting 5 will give you a number ending in 5.  Thus the number of beans on day $k+1$ ends in a 5.
%			\part Try dividing all the numbers by 5, to get $2, 3, 5, 9, 17,\ldots$, which are all one more than a power of 2.  So we guess that $a_n = 5(2^n + 1)$.  To prove that this is correct, note that $5(2^0 + 1) = 10$, the number of beans you have on day 0.  Now assume the formula for $a_n$ is correct on day $k$.  That is, $a_k = 5(2^k+1)$.  The next day we double this and subtract 5, giving $2\cdot 5(2^k+1) - 5 = 5\cdot 2\cdot 2^{k} + 10 - 5 = 5\cdot 2^{k+1} + 5 = 5(2^{k+1}+1) = a_{k+1}$.  So the proposed formula for $a_n$ is true for $n= k+1$ as well.

\question Your magic chocolate bunnies reproduce like rabbits: every large bunny produces 2 new mini bunnies each day, and each day every mini bunny born the previous day grows into a large bunny.  Assume you start with 2 mini bunnies and no bunny ever dies (or gets eaten).

\begin{parts}
	\part Write out the first few terms of the sequence.
	\part Give a recursive definition of the sequence and explain why it is correct.
	\part Find a closed formula for the $n$th term of the sequence.
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
	 \begin{parts}
	 	\part On the first day, your 2 mini bunnies become 2 large bunnies.  On day 2, your two large bunnies produce 4 mini bunnies.  On day 3, you have 4 mini bunnies (produced by your 2 large bunnies) plus 6 large bunnies (your original 2 plus the 4 newly matured bunnies).  On day 4, you will have $12$ mini bunnies (2 for each of the 6 large bunnies) plus 10 large bunnies (your previous 6 plus the 4 newly matured).  The sequence of total bunnies is $2, 2, 6, 10, 22, 42\ldots$ starting with $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 2$.  
	 	\part $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$.  This is because the number of bunnies is equal to the number of bunnies you had the previous day (both mini and large) plus 2 times the number you had the day before that (since all bunnies you had 2 days ago are now large and producing 2 new bunnies each).
	 	\part Using the characteristic root technique, we find $a_n = a2^n + b(-1)^n$, and we can find $a$ and $b$ to give $a_n = \frac{4}{3}2^n + \frac{2}{3}(-1)^n$.
	 \end{parts}

\question Prove the following statements my mathematical induction:

 \part $\d\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} +\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}+\cdots + \frac{1}{n\cdot(n+1)} = \d\frac{n}{n+1}$ for all $n \in \Z^+$.
 \part $4^n - 1$ is a multiple of 3 for all $n \in \N$.

 \part The {\em greatest} amount of postage you {\em cannot} make exactly using 4 and 9 cent stamps is 23 cents.
 \part Every even number squared is divisible by 4.
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
		\begin{parts}
		 \part Hint: $(n+1)^{n+1} > (n+1) \cdot n^{n}$.
		 \part Hint: This should be similar to the other sum proofs - the last bit comes down to adding fractions.
		 \part Hint: Write $4^{k+1} - 1 = 4\cdot 4^k - 4 + 3$.
		 \part Hint: Use the fact $F_{2n} + F_{2n+1} = F_{2n+2}$
		 \part Hint: one 9-cent stamp is 1 more than two 4-cent stamps, and seven 4-cent stamps is 1 more than three 9-cent stamps.
		 \part Careful to actually use induction here.  The base case: $2^2 = 4$.  The inductive case: assume $(2n)^2$ is divisible by 4 and consider $(2n+2)^2 = (2n)^2 + 4n + 4$.  This is divisible by 4 because $4n +4$ clearly is, and by our inductive hypothesis, so is $(2n)^2$.

%\question Explain how we know that $\dfrac{1}{(1-x)^2}$ is the generating function for the sequence $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$
%
%	\begin{answer}
%		Starting with $\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 +\cdots$, we can take derivatives of both sides, given $\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots$.  By the definition of generating functions, this says that $\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$ generates the {\em sequence} 1, 2, 3\ldots.  You can also find this using differencing or by multiplying.

\question Prove, using strong induction, that every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.  For example, $13 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3$.

	\begin{answer}
		Note that $1 = 2^0$ - this is your base case.  Now suppose $k$ can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all $1\le k \le n$.  We can then write $n$ as the sum of distinct powers of 2 as follows: subtract the largest power of 2 less than $n$ from $n$.  That is, write $n = 2^j + k$ for the largest possible $j$.  But $k$ is now less than $n$, and also less than $2^j$, so write $k$ as the sum of distinct powers of 2 (we can do so by the inductive hypothesis).  Thus $n$ can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all $n \ge 1$.
	\end{answer}

\question Prove using induction that every set containing $n$ elements has $2^n$ different subsets for any $n \ge 1$.

	\begin{answer}
		Let $P(n)$ be the statement, ``every set containing $n$ elements has $2^n$ different subsets.''  We will show $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 1$.
		
		\underline{Base case}: Any set with 1 element $\{a\}$ has exactly 2 subsets: the empty set and the set itself.  Thus the number of subsets is $2= 2^1$.  Thus $P(1)$ is true.
		
		\underline{Inductive case}: Suppose $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary $k \ge 1$.  Thus every set containing exactly $k$ elements has $2^k$ different subsets.  Now consider a set containing $k+1$ elements: $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}$.  Any subset of $A$ must either contain $a_{k+1}$ or not.  In other words, a subset of $A$ is just a subset of $\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_k\}$ with or without $a_{k+1}$.  Thus there are $2^k$ subsets of $A$ which contain $a_{k+1}$ and another $2^{k+1}$ subsets of $A$ which do not contain $a^{k+1}$.  This gives a total of $2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}$ subsets of $A$.  But our choice of $A$ was arbitrary, so this works for any subset containing $k+1$ elements, so $P(k+1)$ is true.
		
		Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 1$.
	\end{answer}
