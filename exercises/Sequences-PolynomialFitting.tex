\question Use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the $n$th term of the following sequences:
\begin{parts}
\part 2, 5, 11, 21, 36,\ldots
\part 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, \ldots
\end{parts}

	\begin{answer}
		\begin{parts}
		\part Hint: third differences are constant, so $a_n = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$.  Use the terms of the sequence to solve for $a, b, c,$ and $d$.
		\part $a_n = n^2 - n$
		\end{parts}
	\end{answer}
	
	
	


\question Can you use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the $n$th term of the sequence 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, \ldots?  Explain why or why not. 

	\begin{answer}
		No.  The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence so no differences will be constant. 
	\end{answer}
