\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

  This book would not exist if not for ``Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics'' by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus. It is the book I learned discrete math out of, and taught out of the semester before I began writing this text. I wanted to maintain the inquiry based feel of their book but update, expand and rearrange some of the material.
  %
\par

  In Spring 2015, Alees Seehausen, a graduate student at the University of Northern Colorado, co-taught the Discrete Mathematics course with me and helped develop many of the \emph{Investigate!} activities and other problems currently used in the text. She also offered many suggestions for improvement of the expository text, for which I am quite grateful. Thanks also to Katie Morrison and Nate Eldredge for their suggestions after using parts of this text in their class.
  %
\par

  Finally, a thank you to the numerous students who have pointed out typos and made suggestions over the years and a thanks in advance to those who will do so in the future.

\chapter*{Preface}\label{preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

This text aims to give an introduction to select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate for first or second year undergraduate math majors, especially those who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics. The book began as a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern Colorado. This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as the ``bridge'' course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate ``introduction to proofs'' course. Most students who take the course plan to teach, although there are a handful of students who will go on to graduate school or study applied math or computer science. For these students the current text hopefully is still of interest, but the intent is not to provide a solid mathematical foundation for computer science, unlike the majority of textbooks on the subject.
%
\par

Another difference between this text and most other discrete math books is that this book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem oriented or inquiry based methods. When I teach the class, I will assign sections for reading \emph{after} first introducing them in class by using a mix of group work and class discussion on a few interesting problems. The text is meant to consolidate what we \emph{discover} in class and serve as a reference for students as they master the concepts and techniques covered in the unit. None-the-less, every attempt has been made to make the text sufficient for self study as well, in a way that hopefully mimics an inquiry based classroom.
%
\par

The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the need of the students I teach at UNC. The main areas of study are combinatorics, sequences, logic and proofs, and graph theory, in that order. Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences. Most discrete books put logic first as a preliminary, which certainly has its advantages. However, I wanted to discuss logic and proofs together, and found that doing both of these before anything else was overwhelming for my students given that they didn't yet have context of other problems in the subject. Also, after spending a couple weeks on proofs, we would hardly use that at all when covering combinatorics, so much of the progress we made was quickly lost.
%
\par

Depending on the speed of the class, it might be possible to include additional material. In past semesters I have included generating functions (after sequences) and some basic number theory (either after the logic and proofs chapter or at the very end of the course). These additional topics are covered in appendix A.
%
\par

While I (currently) believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free to skip around to what interests you. There are occasionally examples and exercises that rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum and usually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study. If you are an instructor, feel free to edit the \LaTeX{}~source to fit your needs.

This current Fall 2015 edition of the text is essentially the first edition of the book. I have previously compiled many of the sections in a book format for easy distribution, but those were mostly just lecture notes and exercises (there was no index or Investigate problems; very little in the way of consistent formatting).
%
\par

My intent is to compile a new edition prior to each Fall semester which incorporate additions and corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous semester. Thus I encourage you to send along any suggestions and comments as you have them. For future editions, I will keep track of any major changes here.

\paragraph[\emph{Investigate!} activities]{\emph{Investigate!} activities}\hypertarget{paragraphs-2}{}

  Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very beginning of a topic) you will find activities designed to get you acquainted with the topic soon to be discussed. These are similar (sometimes identical) to group activities I give students to introduce material. You really should spend some time thinking about, or even working through, these problems before reading the section. By priming yourself to the types of issues involved in the material you are about to read, you will better understand what is to come. There are no solutions provided for these problems, but don't worry if you can't solve them or are not confident in your answers. My hope is that you will take this frustration with you while you read the proceeding section. By the time you are done with the section, things should be much clearer.
  %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Examples}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Examples]{Examples}\hypertarget{paragraphs-3}{}

  I have tried to include the ``correct'' number of examples. For those examples which include \emph{problems}, full solutions are included. Before reading the solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking. Unlike some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all inclusive for problems you will see in the exercises. They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other problems. Instead, use the examples to deepen our understanding of the concepts and techniques discussed in each section. Then use this understanding to solve the exercises at the end of each section.
  %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Exercises}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Exercises]{Exercises}\hypertarget{paragraphs-4}{}

  You get good at math through practice. Each section concludes with a small number of exercises meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that section. At the end of each chapter, a larger collection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of ``chapter review'') which might bridge material of different sections in that chapter. Every exercise has either a hint, answer or full solution (which in the pdf version of the text can be found by clicking on the exercises number \textendash{} clicking on the solution number will bring you back to the exercise). Readers are encouraged to try these exercises before looking at the solution. When I teach with this book, I assign these exercises as practice and then use them, or similar problems, on quizzes and exams.
  %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  Homework Problems}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Homework Problems]{Homework Problems}\hypertarget{paragraphs-5}{}

       Each chapter includes a small number of more involved problems \textendash{} the type I would assign as homework to be written up and collected each week. As many of these are problems I assign, solutions are not included. If you are using this book for self study, consider these additional \emph{Investigate!} problems.

      Welcome to Discrete Mathematics. If this is your first time encountering the subject, you will probably find discrete mathematics quite different from other math subjects. You might not even know what discrete math is! Hopefully this short introduction
      will shed some light on what the subject is about and what you can expect as you move forward in your studies.

    Defining \emph{discrete mathematics} is hard because defining \emph{mathematics} is hard. What is mathematics? The study of numbers? In part, but you also study functions and lines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and
    \dots{}. Or perhaps you want to say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems. What sort of problems? Okay, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles,
    \dots{}. Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of ``discrete'' to it, as defined above. Some math fundamentally deals with\dots{} \emph{stuff}\dots{} that is individually separate and distinct.

    In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (maybe the set of number in the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: \([0,\infty)\) is the range of \(f(x) = x^2\) since the set
    of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between
    them which are also in the set. Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number of children each person reading this has. What is the range? I'm guessing
    it is something like \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). Maybe 4 is in there too. But certainly there is nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This set \emph{is} discrete because the elements are separate. Also notice that the inputs to the function
    are a discrete set as each input is an individual person. You would not consider fractional inputs (there is nothing we care about \(2/3\) between a pair of readers).

    One way to get a feel for the subject is to consider the types of problems you solve in discrete math. Here are a few simple examples:

        The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for all of his friends. As a way to kick things off, they decide that everyone should shake hands. Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands with every other person (but not themselves,
        obviously) exactly once, how many handshakes take place?

        At the warm-up event for Oscar's All Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al ate one hot dog. Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs. Not to be outdone, Carl ate five. This continued with each contestant eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant.

        Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns. While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect
        with each other (as stop signs had not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed. Is it possible for each of these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections?

    One reason it is difficult to define discrete math is that it is a very broad description which encapsulates a large number of subjects. In this course we will study four main topics: \terminology{combinatorics} (the theory of ways things \emph{combine};
    in particular, how to count these ways), \terminology{sequences}, \terminology{symbolic logic}, and \terminology{graph theory}. However, there are other topics that belong under the discrete umbrella, including computer science, abstract algebra, number theory, game theory,
    probability, and geometry (some of these, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants).
  %
\par

    Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to \emph{do} it. Let's get started! Before we can begin answering more complicated (and fun) problems, we must lay down some foundation. We start by reviewing sets and functions in
    the framework of discrete mathematics.

        While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls. Each is either a \emph{knight}, who always tells the truth, or a \emph{knave}, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:


        \begin{quote}Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.%
\par
Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.%
\par
Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.%

      In order to \emph{do} mathematics, we must be able to \emph{talk} and
      \emph{write} about mathematics. Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems. As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.
    %

      Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects, and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks: \emph{mathematical statements}.

\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2.1 Atomic and Molecular Statements}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Atomic and Molecular Statements]{Atomic and Molecular Statements}\label{atomic-molecular-statements}

      A \terminology{statement}\index{statement} is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is
      \terminology{atomic} if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called
      \terminology{molecular}.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-1}

          These are statements (in fact,
          \emph{atomic} statements):
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}
              Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.
            %
\item{}
              The moon is made of cheese.
            %
\item{}
              42 is a perfect square.
            %
\item{}
              Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
            %
\item{}
              \(3+7 = 12\)
            %
\end{itemize}
\par

          And these are not statements:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}
              Would you like some cake?
            %
\item{}
              The sum of two squares.
            %
\item{}\(1+3+5+7+\cdots+2n+1\).\item{}
              Go to your room!
            %
\item{}
              \(3+x = 12\)
            %
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\par

      The reason the last sentence is not a statement is because it contains a variable. Depending on what
      \(x\) is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the sentence into a statement is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done in a number of ways. For example,
      ``\(3+x = 12\) where \(x = 9\)'' is a true statement, as is
      ``\(3+x = 12\) for some value of \(x\) ''. This is an example of
      \emph{quantifying} over a variable, which we will discuss more in a bit.
    %
\par

      You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using
      \terminology{logical connectives}
      \index{connectives}. For example, this is a statement:
    %
\begin{quote}
      Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.
    \end{quote}
\par

      Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are
      \emph{connected} by an
      ``and.'' We will consider 5 connectives:
      ``and'' (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman),
      ``or'' (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman),
      ``if\dots{}, then\dots{}'' (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman),
      ``if and only if'' (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and
      ``not'' (Sam is not a man). The first four are called
      \emph{binary connectives} (because they connect two statements) while
      ``not'' is an example of a
      \emph{unary connective} (since it applies to a single statement).
    %
\par

      Which connective we use to modify statment(s) will determine the
      \terminology{truth value}
      \index{truth value} of the molecular statement (that is, whether the statement is true or false), based on the truth values of the statements being modified. It is important to realize that we do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider \terminology{propositional variables} (sometimes called \emph{sentential} variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: \(P, Q, R, S, \ldots\)
      \label{notation-1}
. These are variables that can take on one of two values: T or F. We also have symbols for the logical connectives:
      \(\wedge\),
      \(\vee\),
      \(\imp\),
      \(\iff\),
      \(\neg\).
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Logical Connectives}\label{assemblage-1}\par\medskip

        \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P \wedge Q\) means \(P\) and \(Q\), called a
            \terminology{conjunction}\index{conjunction}\index{connectives!and}.\item{}\(P \vee Q\) means
            \(P\) or
            \(Q\), called a
            \terminology{disjunction}\index{disjunction}\index{connectives!or}.\item{}\(P \imp Q\) means if
            \(P\) then
            \(Q\), called an
            \terminology{implication} or
            \terminology{conditional}\index{implication}\index{conditional}\index{connectives!implies}\index{if\dots{}
                                then}.\item{}\(P \iff Q\) means
            \(P\) if and only if
            \(Q\), called a

            \(P\), called a
            \terminology{negation}\index{negation}\index{connectives!not}.\end{itemize}

      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      The
      \terminology{truth value} of a statement is determined by the truth value(s) of its part(s), depending on the connectives:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Truth Conditions for Connectives}\label{assemblage-2}\par\medskip

        \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P \wedge Q\) is true when both
            \(P\) and
            \(Q\) are true\item{}\(P \vee Q\) is true when
            \(P\) or
            \(Q\) or both are true.\item{}\(P \imp Q\) is true when
            \(P\) is false or
            \(Q\) is true or both.\item{}\(P \iff Q\) is true when
            \(P\) and
            \(Q\) are both true, or both false.\item{}\(\neg P\) is true when
            \(P\) is false.\end{itemize}

      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      Note that for us,
      \emph{or} is the
      \terminology{inclusive or}
      \index{inclusive or} (and not the sometimes used
      \emph{exclusive or}) meaning that
      \(P \vee Q\) is in fact true when both
      \(P\) and
      \(Q\) are true. As for the other connectives,
      ``and'' behaves as you would expect, as does negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are
      \emph{equivalent}. This leaves only the conditional
      \(P \imp Q\) which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and as such, they deserve their own subsection.
    %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2.2 Implications}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Implications]{Implications}\label{subsec_implications}

      Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the conditional, or implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the
      \emph{Pythagorean Theorem}. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as
      ``
                    \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).'' This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. But perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables. So
      \(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\)??? How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as
      \(a\) and
      \(b\) are the legs or a right triangle and
      \(c\) is the hypotenuse. In other words:

      \begin{quote}\emph{If
                    }\(a\) and
        \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse
        \(c\),
        \emph{then
                    }\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).
      \end{quote}

    %
\par

      This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion (``then'' part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis (``if'' part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.
    %
\par

      Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and as such either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-2}
Consider the statement:
          \begin{quote}if Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.\end{quote}

          This is definitely an implication:
          \(P\) is the statement,
          ``Bob gets a 90 on the final,'' and
          \(Q\) is the statement,
          ``Bob will pass the class.''
        %
\par

          Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. But if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases,
          \(P\) was false, and the statement
          \(P \imp Q\) was true. In the first case,
          \(Q\) was true, and so was
          \(P \imp Q\). So
          \(P \imp Q\) is true when either
          \(P\) is false or
          \(Q\) is true.
        %
\end{example}
\par

      Just to be clear, although we sometimes read
      \(P \imp Q\) as
      ``
                    \(P\)
                    \emph{implies}
                    \(Q\)
                '', we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements
      \(P\) and
      \(Q\). In particular, if you claim that
      \(P \imp Q\) is
      \emph{false}, you are not saying that
      \(P\) does not imply
      \(Q\), but rather that
      \(P\) is true and
      \(Q\) is false.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-3}
Decide which of the following statements are true and which are false. Briefly explain.

        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          All four of the statements are true. Remember, the only way for an implication to be false is for the
          \emph{if} part to be true and the
          \emph{then} part to be false.
          \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-29}{}Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the implication is true.
            \item\hypertarget{li-30}{}Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion is true, so the implication is true. It does not matter that there is no logical connection between the true mathematical fact and the fact about horses.\item\hypertarget{li-31}{}I have no idea what the 7624th digit of
              \(\pi\) is, but this does not matter. Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is automatically true.\item\hypertarget{li-32}{}Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis, the conclusion is true, making the implication true.\end{enumerate}

        %
\end{example}
\par

      It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to
      \emph{prove} that it is. Proofs by seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. And if you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Direct Proofs of Implications}\label{assemblage-3}\par\medskip

        To prove an implication
        \(P \imp Q\), it is enough to assume
        \(P\) and from it deduce
        \(Q\).
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most elegant style of proof and have the advantage that such a proof often does a great job of explaining
      \emph{why} the statement is true.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-4}

          Prove: If two numbers
          \(a\) and
          \(b\) are even, then their sum
          \(a+b\) is even.
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          Suppose the numbers
          \(a\) and
          \(b\) are even. This means that
          \(a = 2k\) and
          \(b=2j\) for some integers
          \(k\) and
          \(j\). The sum is then
          \(a+b = 2k+2j = 2(k+j)\). Since
          \(k+j\) is an integer, this means that
          \(a+b\) is even.
        %
\par

          Notice that since we get to assume the hypothesis of the implication we immediately have a place to start. The proof proceeds essentially by repeatedly asking and answering,
          ``what does that mean?''
        %
\end{example}
\par

      This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever found yourself starting an argument with,
      ``hypothetically, let's assume
                    '' then you have attempted a direct proof of you desired conclusion.
    %
\par

      Since implications are so prevalent in mathematics, we have some special language to help discuss them:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Converse and Contrapositive}\label{assemblage-4}\par\medskip

        \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}
              The
              \terminology{converse}
              \index{converse} of an implication
              \(P \imp Q\) is the implication
              \(Q \imp P\). The converse is
              NOT logically equivalent to the original implication.
            %
\item{}
              The
              \terminology{contrapositive}
              \index{contrapositive} of an implication
              \(P \imp Q\) is the statement
              \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\). An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).
            %
\end{itemize}

      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications with a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square. While this happens often, it does not always happen. For example, they Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if
      \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), then the triangle with sides
      \(a\),
      \(b\), and
      \(c\) is a
      \emph{right} triangle. Whenever you encounter a implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.
    %
\par

      The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-5}
True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit. Is the converse true?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you
          \emph{don't} have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).
        %
\par

          The converse: If you have at least three card all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit) but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).
        %

      Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications and their truth values:
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-6}

          Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93\% on her final, then she will get an A in the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-35}{}Sue gets a 93\% on her final.\item\hypertarget{li-36}{}Sue gets an A in the class.\item\hypertarget{li-37}{}Sue does not get a 93\% on her final.\item\hypertarget{li-38}{}Sue does not get an A in the class.\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          Note first that whenever
          \(P \imp Q\) and
          \(P\) are both true statements,
          \(Q\) must be true as well. For this problem, take
          \(P\) to mean
          ``Sue gets a 93\%
                            on her final'' and
          \(Q\) to mean
          ``Sue will get an A in the class.''
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-39}{}We have
            \(P \imp Q\) and
            \(P\) so
            \(Q\) follows. Sue gets an A.\item\hypertarget{li-40}{}You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an
            \(A\), then she gets a 93\% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.\item\hypertarget{li-41}{}The inverse of
            \(P \imp Q\) is
            \(\neg P \imp \neg Q\), which states that if Sue does not get a 93\% on the final then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.\item\hypertarget{li-42}{}What would happen if Sue does not get an A but
            \emph{did} get a 93\% on the final. Then
            \(P\) would be true and
            \(Q\) would be false. But this makes the implication
            \(P \imp Q\) false! So it must be that Sue did not get a 93\% on the final. Notice now we have the implication
            \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) which is the contrapositive of
            \(P \imp Q\). Since
            \(P \imp Q\) is assumed to be true, we know
            \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) is true as well.\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

      As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse, but it is possible that both are true. In this case, when both
      \(P \imp Q\) and
      \(Q \imp P\) are true, we say that
      \(P\) and
      \(Q\) are equivalent. This is the biconditional we mentioned earlier:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{If and only if}\label{assemblage-5}\par\medskip

        \begin{quote}  \(P \iff Q\) is logically equivalent to \((P \imp Q) \wedge (Q \imp P)\).%
\end{quote}

      %
\par

        Example: Given an integer
        \(n\), it is true that
        \(n\) is even if and only if
        \(n^2\) is even. That is, if
        \(n\) is even, then
        \(n^2\) is even, as well as the converse: if
        \(n^2\) is even, then
        \(n\) is even.
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      You can think of
      ``if and only if'' statements as having two parts: an implication and its converse. We might say one is the
      ``if'' part, and the other is the
      ``only if'' part. We also sometimes say that
      ``if and only if'' statements have two directions: a forward direction
      \((P \imp Q)\) and a backwards direction (\(P \leftarrow Q\), which is really just sloppy notation for
      \(Q \imp P\)).
    %
\par

      Let's think a little about which part is which. Is
      \(P \imp Q\) the
      ``if'' part or the
      ``only if'' part? Perhaps we should look at an example.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-7}

          Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower. We know this means that both if I sing, then I'm in the shower, and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing. Let
          \(P\) be the statement,
          ``I sing,'' and
          \(Q\) be,
          ``I'm in the shower.'' So
          \(P \imp Q\) is the statement
          ``if I sing, then I'm in the shower.'' Which part of the if and only if statement is this?
        %
\par

          What we are really asking is what is the meaning of
          ``I sing if I'm in the shower'' and
          ``I sing only if I'm in the shower.'' When is the first one (the
          ``if'' part)
          \emph{false}? When I am in the shower but not singing. That is the same condition on being false as the statement
          ``if I'm in the shower, then I sing.'' So the
          ``if'' part is
          \(Q \imp P\). On the other hand, to say,
          ``I sing only if I'm in the shower'' is equivalent to saying
          ``if I sing, then I'm in the shower,'' so the only if part is
          \(P \imp Q\).
        %
\end{example}
\par

      It is not terribly important to know which part is the if or only if part, but this does get at something very, very important: THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO STATE AN IMPLICATION! The problem is, since these are all different ways of saying the same implication, we cannot use truth tables to analyze the situation. Instead, we just need good English skills.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-8}

          Rephrase the implication,
          ``if I dream, then I am asleep'' in as many different ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          The following are all equivalent to the original implication:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-43}{} I am asleep if I dream. %
\item\hypertarget{li-44}{} I dream only if I am asleep. %
\item\hypertarget{li-45}{} In order to dream, I must be asleep. %
\item\hypertarget{li-46}{} To dream, it is necessary that I am asleep. %
\item\hypertarget{li-47}{} To be asleep, it is sufficient to dream. %
\item\hypertarget{li-48}{} I am not dreaming unless I am asleep. %
\end{enumerate}
\par

          The following are equivalent to the converse (if I am asleep, then I dream):
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-49}{}
              I dream if I am asleep.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-50}{}
              I am asleep only if I dream.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-51}{}
              It is necessary that I dream in order to be asleep.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-52}{}
              It is sufficient that I be asleep in order to dream.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-53}{}
              If I don't dream, then I'm not asleep.
            %
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

      Hopefully you agree with the above example. We include the
      ``necessary and sufficient'' versions because those are common when discussing mathematics. In fact, let's agree once and for all what they mean:

                                is necessary for
                                \(Q\)
                            '' means

            \(P \imp Q\).\item{}
              If
              \(P\) is necessary and sufficient for
              \(Q\), then
              \(P \iff Q\).
            %
\end{itemize}

      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      To be honest, I have trouble with these if I'm not very careful. I find it helps to have an example in mind:
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-9}

          Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point
          \(c\), then it is continuous at
          \(c\), but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example,
          \(f(x) = |x|\) at the point 0). Restate this fact using necessary and sufficient language.
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable at a point
          \(c\), it is necessary for the function to be continuous at
          \(c\). However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at
          \(c\) for it to be continuous at
          \(c\).
        %
\par

          It is true that to be continuous at a point
          \(c\), it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at
          \(c\). However, it is not the case that being continuous at
          \(c\) is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at
          \(c\).
        %
\end{example}
\par

      Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts would
      \emph{be enough} (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true.

      It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences. For example, suppose we wanted to claim that if
      \(n\) is prime, then
      \(n+7\) is not prime. This looks like an implication. I would like to write something like
      \begin{equation*}
        P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7)
      \end{equation*}
      where
      \(P(n)\) means
      ``
                    \(n\)
                    is prime.'' But this is not quite right. For one thing, because this sentence has a free variable (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about), it is not a statement. Now if we plug in a specific value for
      \(n\), we do get a statement. In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for
      \(n\), we get a true implication. So what we really want to say is that
      \emph{for all} values of
      \(n\), if
      \(n\) is prime, then
      \(n+7\) is not. We need to
      \emph{quantify} the variable.
    %
\par

      Although there are many types of
      \emph{quantifiers} in English (e.g., many, few, most, etc.) in mathematics we for the most part stick to two: existential and universal.
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Universal and Existential Quantifiers}\label{assemblage-7}\par\medskip

        \index{quantifiers}
      %
\par

        The existential quantifier is
        \(\exists\) and is read
        ``there exists'' or
        ``there is.'' For example,\index{existential quantifier}
        \index{quantifiers!exists}
        \begin{equation*}
          \exists x (x \lt 0)
        \end{equation*}
        asserts that there is a number less than 0.
      %
\par

        The universal quantifier is
        \(\forall\) and is read
        ``for all'' or
        ``every.'' For example,\index{universal quantifier}
        \index{quantifiers!for all}
        \begin{equation*}
          \forall x (x \ge 0)
        \end{equation*}
        asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      As with all mathematical statements, we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false. Consider the statement
      \begin{equation*}
        \forall x \exists y (y \lt x).
      \end{equation*}
      You would read this,
      ``for every
                    \(x\)
                    there is is some
                    \(y\)
                    such that
                    \(y\)
                    is less than
                    \(x\).'' Is this true? The answer depends on what our
      \emph{domain of discourse} is: when we say
      ``for all''
      \(x\), do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set? Usually this information is implied. In discrete mathematics, we almost always quantify over the
      \emph{natural numbers}, 0, 1, 2,
      , so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.
    %
\par

      For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let
      \(y\) be
      \(x-1\)? But here is the problem: what if
      \(x = 0\)? Then
      \(y = -1\) and that is
      \emph{not a number!} (in our domain of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is not true because there is a number such that every number is at least as large as. or in symbols,
      \begin{equation*}
        \exists x \forall y (y \ge x).
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the
      \emph{negation} was true. And notice how the negation and original statement compare. This is typical.
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Quantifiers and Negation}\label{assemblage-8}\par\medskip

        \begin{quote}
            \(\neg \forall x P(x)\) is equivalent to
            \(\exists x \neg P(x)\).%
\par

            \(\neg \exists x P(x)\) is equivalent to
            \(\forall x \neg P(x)
                            \).%
\end{quote}

      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but that causes the quantifier to switch type. This should not be surprising: if not everything is a property, then something doesn't have that property. And if there is not something with a property, then everything doesn't have that property.

\typeout{Introduction  }
\typeout{************************************************}

      The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in all of math) are
      \terminology{sets}
      \index{set}. Much of what follows might be review, but it is very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory. Most of the notation we use below is standard, although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.
    %
\par

      For us, a set will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played \emph{The Doctor} on \emph{Doctor Who}\index{Doctor Who}, or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is a element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word ``questionably'' (namely, all of them); we do not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set or not.
    %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.3.1 Notation}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Notation]{Notation}\label{subsec_notation}

      We need some notation to make talking about sets easier. Consider,
      \begin{equation*}
        A = \{1, 2, 3\}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      This is read, ``\(A\) is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3.'' We use curly braces ``\(\{,~~ \}\)'' to enclose elements of a set. Some more notation:
      \begin{equation*}
        a \in \{a, b, c\}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      The symbol ``\(\in\)'' is read ``is in'' or ``is an element of.'' Thus the above means that \(a\) is an element of the set containing the letters \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Note that this is a true statement. It would also be true to say that \(d\) is not in that set:
      \begin{equation*}
        d \not\in \{a, b, c\}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      Be warned: we write ``\(x \in A\)'' when we wish to express that one of the elements of the set \(A\) is \(x\). For example, consider the set,
      \begin{equation*}
        A = \{1, b, \{x, y, z\}, \emptyset\}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      This is a strange set, to be sure. It contains four elements: the number 1, the letter b, the set \(\{x,y,z\}\), and the empty set (\(\emptyset = \{ \}\), the set containing no elements). Is \(x\) in \(A\)? The answer is no. None of the four elements in \(A\) are the letter \(x\), so we must conclude that \(x \notin A\). Similarly, consider the set \(B = \{1,b\}\). Even though the elements of \(B\) are elements of \(A\), we cannot say that the \emph{set} \(B\) is one of the elements of \(A\). Therefore \(B \notin A\). (Soon we will see that \(B\) is a \emph{subset} of \(A\), but this is different from being an element of \(A\).)
    %
\par

      We have described the sets above by listing their elements. Sometimes this is hard to do, especially when there are lots of elements in the set (perhaps infinitely many). For instance, if we want \(A\) to be the set of all even natural numbers, would could write,
      \begin{equation*}
        A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\},
      \end{equation*}
      but this is a little imprecise. Better would be
      \begin{equation*}
        A = \{x \in \N \st \exists n\in \N ( x = 2 n)\}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      Breaking that down: ``\(x \in \N\)'' means \(x\) is in the set \(\N\) \label{notation-2}
 (the set of natural numbers, starting with 0), \(:\) \label{notation-3}
 is read ``such that'' and ``\(\exists n\in \N (x = 2n) \)
      '' is read ``there exists an \(n\) in the natural numbers for which \(x\) is two times \(n\)'' (in other words, \(x\) is even). Slightly easier might be,
      \begin{equation*}
        A = \{x \st \mbox{  is even} \}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      Note: sometimes people use \(|\) or \(\backepsilon\) for the ``such that'' symbol instead of the colon.
    %
\par

      Defining a set using this sort of notation is very useful, although it takes some practice to read them correctly. It is a way to describe the set of all things that satisfy some condition (the condition is the logical statement after the ``\(\st\)'' symbol). Here are some more examples.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-10}

          Describe each of the following sets both in words and by listing out enough elements to see the pattern.

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-155}{}
              This is the set of all number which are 3 less than a natural number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number). The set could also be written as \(\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\) (note that 0 is a natural number, so
              \(-3\) is in this set because \(-3 + 3 = 0\)).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-156}{}
              This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a natural number. So here we just have \(\{0, 1, 2,3 \ldots\}\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-157}{}
              This is the set of all integers
              \index{integers} (positive and negative whole numbers, written \(\Z\)). In other words, \(\{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-158}{}
              Here we want all numbers \(x\) such that \(x\) and \(-x\) are natural numbers. There is only one: 0. So we have the set \(\{0\}\).
            %
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[Relationships Between Sets]{Relationships Between Sets}\label{subsection-5}

      We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: they have exactly the same elements. Thus, for example,
      \begin{equation*}
        \{1, 2, 3\} = \{2, 1, 3\}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      (Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.) Also,
      \begin{equation*}
        \{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 1+1, 1+1+1\} = \{I, II, III\}
      \end{equation*}
      since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers (how we write them doesn't matter, just what they are).
    %
\par

      What about the sets \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)? Clearly \(A \ne B\), but notice that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). Because of this we say that \(A\) is a \emph{subset}
      \index{subset} of \(B\), or in symbols \(A \subset B\) or \(A \subseteq B\). (Both symbols are read ``is a subset of.'' The difference is that sometimes we want to say that \(A\) is either equal to or a subset of \(B\), in which case we use \(\subseteq\). This is analoguous to the difference between \(\lt\) and \(\le\).)
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-11}

          Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), \(B = \{2, 4, 6\}\), \(C = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(D = \{7, 8, 9\}\). Determine which of the following are true, false, or meaningless.

\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-195}{}
              False. For example, \(1\in A\) but \(1 \notin B\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-196}{}
              True. Every element in \(B\) is an element in \(A\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-197}{}
              False. The elements in \(C\) are 1, 2, and 3. The \emph{set} \(B\) is not equal to 1, 2, or 3.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-198}{}
              False. \(A\) has exactly 6 elements, and none of them are the empty set.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-199}{}
              True. Everything in the empty set (nothing) is also an element of \(A\). Notice that the empty set is a subset of every set.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-200}{}
              Meaningless. A set cannot be less than another set.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-201}{}
              True. \(3\) is one of the elements of the set \(C\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-202}{}
              Meaningless. \(3\) is not a set, so it cannot be a subset of another set.
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-203}{}
              True. \(3\) is the only element of the set \(\{3\}\), and is an element of \(C\), so every element in \(\{3\}\) is an element of \(C\).
            %
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

      In the example above, \(B\) is a subset of \(A\). You might wonder what other sets are subsets of \(A\). If you collect all these subsets of \(A\) into a new set, we get a set of sets. We call the set of all subsets of \(A\) the \emph{power set}
      \index{power set} of \(A\), and write it \(\pow(A)\).
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-12}

          Let \(A = \{1,2,3\}\). Find \(\pow(A)\).
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          \(\pow(A)\) is a set of sets, all of which are subsets of \(A\). So
          \begin{equation*}
            \pow(A) = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}.
          \end{equation*}
        %
\par

          Notice that while \(2 \in A\), it is wrong to write \(2 \in \pow(A)\) since none of the elements in \(\pow(A)\) are numbers! On the other hand, we do have \(\{2\} \in \pow(A)\) because \(\{2\} \subseteq A\).
        %
\par

          What does a subset of \(\pow(A)\) look like? Notice that \(\{2\} \not\subseteq \pow(A)\) because not everything in \(\{2\}\) is in \(\pow(A)\). But we do have \(\{ \{2\} \} \subseteq \pow(A)\). The only element of \(\{\{2\}\}\) is the set \(\{2\}\) which is also an element of \(\pow(A)\). We could take the collection of all subsets of \(\pow(A)\) and call that \(\pow(\pow(A))\). Or even the power set of that set of sets of sets.
        %
\end{example}
\par

      Another way to compare sets is by their size. Notice that in the example above, \(A\) has 6 elements, \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) all have 3 elements. The size of a set is called the set's \emph{cardinality}
      \index{cardinality}. We would write \(|A| = 6\), \(|B| = 3\), and so on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality of \(\{ 1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\) is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, \(\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\) is exactly the same set as \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)). There are sets with infinite cardinality, such as \(\N\), the set of rational numbers (written \(\mathbb Q\)), the set of even natural numbers, and the set of real numbers (\(\mathbb R\)). It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.

\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-207}{}
              Since \(38 - 23 = 15\), we can conclude that the cardinality of the set is \(|A| = 16\) (you need to add one since 23 is included).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-208}{}
              Here \(|B| = 3\). The three elements are the number 1, the set \(\{2,3,4\}\), and the empty set.

\item\hypertarget{li-209}{}

\subsection[Operations On Sets]{Operations On Sets}\label{subsection-6}

      Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then we can take the \emph{union}
      \index{union} of the two sets. Symbolically,
      \begin{equation*}
        C = A \cup B,
      \end{equation*}
      read, ``\(C\) is the union of \(A\) and \(B\),'' means that the elements of \(C\) are exactly the elements which are either an element of \(A\) or an element of \(B\) (or an element of both). For example, if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
    %
\par

      The other common operation on sets is \emph{intersection}
      \index{intersection}. We write,
      \begin{equation*}
        C = A \cap B
      \end{equation*}
      and say, ``\(C\) is the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\),'' when the elements in \(C\) are precisely those both in \(A\) and in \(B\). So if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cap B = \{2, 3\}\).
    %
\par

      Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what ``everything'' is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers. In this case we would say that our \emph{universe} is \(\N\). Sometimes we denote this universe by \(\U\). Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements which are \emph{not} in a particular set. We say \(B\) is the \emph{complement}
      \index{complement} of \(A\), and write,
      \begin{equation*}
        B = \bar A
      \end{equation*}
      when \(B\) contains every element not contained in \(A\). So, if our universe is \(\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}\), and \(A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}\), then \(\bar A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}\).
    %
\par

      Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time. For example, consider
      \begin{equation*}
        A \cap \bar B.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      This is the set of all elements which are both elements of \(A\) and not elements of \(B\). What have we done? We've started with \(A\) and removed all of the elements which were in \(B\). Another way to write this is the \emph{set difference}
      \index{set difference}
      \index{difference, of sets}:
      \begin{equation*}
        A \cap \bar B = A \setminus B.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection, complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets. Don't confuse these with the symbols from the previous section (element of and subset of). \(A \cap B\) is a set, while \(A \subseteq B\) is true or false. This is the same difference as between \(3 + 2\) (which is a number) and \(3 \le 2\) (which is false).

          Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), \(B = \{2, 4, 6\}\), \(C = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(D = \{7, 8, 9\}\). If the universe is \(\U = \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}\), find:

First we find that \(B \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\), then we take everything not in that set.\item\hypertarget{li-224}{}\(A \setminus B = \{1, 3, 5\}\) since the elements 1, 3, and 5 are in \(A\) but not in \(B\). This is the same as \(A \cap \bar B\).\item\hypertarget{li-225}{}\((D \cap \bar C) \cup \bar{A \cap B} = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10\}.\) The set contains all elements that are either in \(D\) but not in \(C\) (\(\{7,8,9\}\)), or not in both \(A\) and \(B\) (\(\{1,3,5,7,8,9,10\}\)).\item\hypertarget{li-226}{}\(\emptyset \cup C = C\) since nothing is added by the empty set.\item\hypertarget{li-227}{}\(\emptyset \cap C = \emptyset\) since nothing can be both in a set and in the empty set.\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

      You might notice that the symbols for union and intersection slightly resemble the logic symbols for ``or'' and ``and.'' This is no accident. What does it mean for \(x\) to be an element of \(A\cup B\)? It means that \(x\) is an element of \(A\) \emph{or} \(x\) is an element of \(B\) (or both). That is,
      \begin{equation*}
        x \in A \cup B \qquad \Iff \qquad x \in A \vee x \in B.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      Similarly,
      \begin{equation*}
        x \in A \cap B \qquad \Iff \qquad x \in A \wedge x \in B.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      Also,
      \begin{equation*}
        x \in \bar A \qquad \Iff \qquad \neg (x \in A).
      \end{equation*}
      which says \(x\) is an element of the complement of \(A\) if \(x\) is not an element of \(A\).
    %
\par

      There is one more way to combine sets which will be useful for us: the \emph{Cartesian product}, \(A \times B\). This sounds fancy but is nothing you haven't seen before. When you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in the Cartesian plane. This is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers \((x,y)\). We can do this for \emph{any} pair of sets, not just the real numbers with themselves.
    %
\par

      Put another way, \(A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A \wedge b \in B\}\). The first coordinate comes from the first set and the second coordinate comes from the second set. Sometimes we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with itself, and this is fine: \(A \times A = \{(a,b) \st a, b \in A\}\) (we might also write \(A^2\) for this set). Notice that in \(A \times A\), we still want \emph{all} ordered pairs, not just the ones where the first and second coordinate are the same. We can also take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or quadruples, and so on.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-15}

          Let \(A = \{1,2\}\) and \(B = \{3,4,5\}\). Find \(A \times B\) and \(A \times A\). How many elements do you expect to be in \(B \times B\)?
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          \(A \times B = \{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\}\).
        %
\par

          \(A \times A = A^2 = \{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}\).
        %
\par

          \(|B\times B| = 9\). There will be 3 pairs with first coordinate \(3\), three more with first coordinate \(4\), and a final three with first coordinate \(5\).

      \index{Venn diagram} There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets. Venn diagrams display sets as intersecting circles. We can shade the region we are talking about when we carry out an operation. We can also represent cardinality of a particular set by putting the number in the corresponding region.

      Each circle represents a set. The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe. To represent combinations of these sets, we shade the corresponding region. For example, we could draw \(A \cap B\) as:
    %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
        \begin{tikzpicture}[fill=gray!50,scale=0.85]

 \draw[thick] \circleA \circleAlabel \circleB \circleBlabel \twosetbox;

      Here is a representation of \(A \cap \bar B\), or equivalently \(A \setminus B\):

      Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of \(C\), then excluded the region where \(C\) and \(A\) overlap outside of \(B\). That region is \((A \cap C) \cap \bar B\). So the above Venn diagram also represents \(C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}.\) So using just the picture, we have determined that
      \begin{equation*}
        (B \cap C) \cup (C \cap \bar A) = C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}.

\section[Functions]{Functions}\label{sec_intro-functions}
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Introduction  }
\typeout{************************************************}

      A
      \terminology{function}\index{function} is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. The set of all inputs for a function is called the
      \terminology{domain}\index{domain}. The set of all allowable outputs is called the
      \terminology{codomain}\index{codomain}. We would write \(f:X \to Y\) to describe a function with name \(f\), domain \(X\) and codomain \(Y\). This does not tell us \emph{which} function \(f\) is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule). %
\par
 For example, consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) defined by \(f(x) = x^2 + 3\). Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers). The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the codomain). Notice though that not every natural number actually is an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers that are \emph{actually outputs} is called the
      \terminology{range}\index{range} of the function (in this case, the range is \(\{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, \ldots\}\), all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).
    %
\par

      The key thing that makes a rule actually a \emph{function} is that there is \emph{exactly one} output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.
    %
\par

      The description of the rule can vary greatly. We might just give a list of each output for each input. You could also describe the function with a table or a graph or in words.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-16}

          The following are all examples of functions:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-276}{}\(f:\Z \to \Z\) defined by \(f(n) = 3n\). The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.\item\hypertarget{li-277}{}\(g: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b,c\}\) defined by \(g(1) = c\), \(g(2) = a\) and \(g(3) = a\). The domain is the set \(\{1,2,3\}\), the codomain is the set \(\{a,b,c\}\) and the range is the set \(\{a,c\}\). Note that \(g(2)\) and \(g(3)\) are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since each element in the domain still has only one output.\item\hypertarget{li-278}{}\(h:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}\) defined as follows:

            \leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
          \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.85]
  \draw[->] (-1,1) node[above] {1} -- (0,0) node[below] {2};
  \draw[->] (0,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1,0) node[below] {1};
  \draw[->] (1,1) node[above] {3} -- (1,0) node[below] {3};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

            This means that the function \(f\) sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just follow the arrows.
          \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

      The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions with \emph{finite} domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function. A graph of the function in example 3 above would look like this:
    %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75]
  \draw[thin, gray!50] (0,0) grid (3.5, 3.5);
  \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0,3.5);
 \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (3.5,0);
 \fill (1,2) circle (3pt) (2,1) circle (3pt) (3,3) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

      It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve suggests that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers. Remember, we are not in calculus any more!
    %
\par

      Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, let's adopt some notation that is a little easier to work with than that of examples 2 and 3 above. All we need is some clear way of denoting which elements of the codomain each element in the domain is assigned. In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:

      \leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(x\)}&0&1&2&3&4\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(f(x)\)}&3&3&2&4&1
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

    %
\par

      We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input directly over its output:
      \begin{equation*}
        f = \begin{pmatrix}0 \amp 1 \amp 2\amp 3 \amp 4 \\ 3 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 1\end{pmatrix}
      \end{equation*}
      Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).
    %
\par

      It is important to know how to determine if a rule is or is not a function. Drawing the arrow diagrams can help.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-17}

          Which of the following diagrams represent a function? Let \(X = \{1,2,3,4\}\) and \(Y = \{a,b,c,d\}\).

\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          \(f\) is a function. So is \(g\). There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the output for any input, and there is no problem with \(a\) from the codomain being the output of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line matrix notation to write these as
          \begin{equation*}
            f= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp c \amp b \end{pmatrix} \qquad g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp a \amp b \end{pmatrix}.
          \end{equation*}

        %
\par

          However, \(h\) is not a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (\(a\) and \(c\)). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:

          It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for \(h\). We would have something like:
          \begin{equation*}
            h=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ \amp a,c? \amp d \amp b\end{pmatrix}.
          \end{equation*}
          There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, two-line notation will always ``work''.

      In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort of the thing \emph{does not} happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is
      \terminology{onto}\index{onto} or that the function maps the domain \emph{onto} the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy math term for an onto function is a
      \terminology{surjection}\index{surjection}, and we say that an onto function is a
      \terminology{surjective} function.

\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-282}{}\(f\) is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no \(n \in \Z\) gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that \(\frac{1}{3}\) would be sent to 1, but \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is \(3\Z\) (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to \(\Z\).\item\hypertarget{li-283}{}\(g\) is not surjective. There is no \(x \in \{1,2,3\}\) (the domain) for which \(g(x) = b\), so \(b\), which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain ``missing'' from the bottom row of the matrix.\item\hypertarget{li-284}{}\(h\) is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\par

      To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse \emph{is} permissible: a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this \emph{does not} occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is assigned to at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is
      \terminology{one-to-one}\index{one-to-one}. Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an
      \terminology{injection}\index{injection}. We call one-to-one functions
      \terminology{injective} functions.

If \(x\) is a multiple of three, then only \(x/3\) is mapped to \(x\). If \(x\) is not a multiple of 3, then there is no input corresponding to the output \(x\).\item\hypertarget{li-289}{}\(g\) is not injective. Both inputs \(2\) and \(3\) are assigned the output \(a\).

      From the examples above, it should be clear that there are functions which are surjective, injective, both, or neither. In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection), we say the function is a

      \terminology{bijective} function.

\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.4.2 Inverse Image}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Inverse Image]{Inverse Image}\label{subsection-9}

      When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say \(x\)) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write \(f(x)\), which \emph{is} the element corresponding to \(x\)). It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say \(y\)) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain get sent to it. We could write ``those \(x\) in the domain such that \(f(x) = y\),'' but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.
    %
\par

      Suppose \(f:X \to Y\) is a function. For \(y \in Y\) (an element of the codomain), we write \(f\inv(y)\)\label{notation-4}
 to represent the \emph{set} of all elements in the domain \(X\) which get sent to \(y\). That is, \(f\inv(y) = \{x \in X \st f(x) = y\}\). We say that \(f\inv(y)\) is the
      \terminology{complete inverse image}\index{inverse image} of \(y\) under \(f\).
    %
\par

      WARNING: \(f\inv(y)\) is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but \(f\inv(y)\) is defined for any function \(f\). The point: \(f\inv(y)\) is a \emph{>set}, not an \emph{element} of the domain.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-20}

          Consider the function \(f:\{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \to \{a,b,c,d\}\) given by
          \begin{equation*}
            f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \\ a \amp a \amp b \amp c \amp c \amp c\end{pmatrix}.
          \end{equation*}
          Find the complete inverse image of each element in the codomain.
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          Remember, we are looking for sets.
          \begin{equation*}
            f\inv(a) = \{1,2\}
          \end{equation*}
        %
\begin{equation*}
          f\inv(b) = \{3\}
        \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
          f\inv(c) = \{4,5,6\}
        \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
          f\inv(d) = \emptyset.
        \end{equation*}\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-21}

          Consider the function \(g:\Z \to \Z\) defined by \(g(n) = n^2 + 1\). Find \(g\inv(1)\), \(g\inv(2)\), \(g\inv(3)\) and \(g\inv(10)\).
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          To find \(g\inv(1)\), we need to find all integers \(n\) such that \(n^2 + 1 = 1\). Clearly only 0 works, so \(g\inv(1) = \{0\}\) (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).
        %
\par

          To find \(g\inv(2)\), we need to find all \(n\) such that \(n^2 + 1 = 2\). We see \(g\inv(2) = \{-1,1\}\).
        %
\par

          If \(n^2 + 1 = 3\), then we are looking for an \(n\) such that \(n^2 = 2\). There are no such integers so \(g\inv(3) = \emptyset\).
        %
\par

          Finally, \(g\inv(10) = \{-3, 3\}\) because \(g(-3) = 10\) and \(g(3) = 10\).
        %
\end{example}
\par

      Since \(f\inv(y)\) is a set, it makes sense to ask for \(\card{f\inv(y)}\), the number of elements in the domain which map to \(y\).
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-22}

          Find a function \(f:\{1,2,3,4,5\} \to \N\) such that \(\card{f\inv(7)} = 5\).
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          There is only one such function. We need five elements of the domain to map to the number \(7 \in \N\). Since there are only five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7. So
          \begin{equation*}
            f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \\ 7 \amp 7 \amp 7 \amp 7 \amp 7\end{pmatrix}.
          \end{equation*}

              \terminology{domain}, to exactly one element of a second set, called the
              \terminology{codomain}.
            %
\item{}
              Notation: \(f:X \to Y\) is our way of saying that the function is called \(f\), the domain is the set \(X\), and the codomain is the set \(Y\).
            %
\item{}
              To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use
              \terminology{two-line notation} by writing a matrix with each output directly below its corresponding input, as in:
              \begin{equation*}
                f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ 2 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}.
              \end{equation*}

            %
\item{}\(f(x) = y\) means the element \(x\) of the domain (input) is assigned to the element \(y\) of the codomain. We say \(y\) is an output. Alternatively, we call \(y\) the
              \terminology{image of \(x\) under \(f\)}.%
\item{}
              The
              \terminology{range} is a subset of the codomain. It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function. That is, the range is the set of all outputs.
            %
\item{}
              A function is
              \terminology{injective} (an
              \terminology{injection} or
              \terminology{one-to-one}) if every element of the codomain is the output for
              \terminology{at most} one element from the domain.
            %
\item{}
              A function is
              \terminology{surjective} (a
              \terminology{surjection} or
              \terminology{onto}) if every element of the codomain is the output of
              \terminology{at least} one element of the domain.
            %
\item{}
              A
              \terminology{bijection} is a function which is both an injection and surjection. In other words, if every element of the codomain is the output of
              \terminology{exactly one} element of the domain.
            %
\item{}
              The
              \terminology{complete inverse image} of an element in the codomain, written \(f\inv(y)\), is the \emph{set} of all elements in the domain which are assigned to \(y\) by the function.

One of the first things you learn in mathematics is how to count. Now we want to count large collections of things quickly and precisely. For example:
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}
In a group of 10 people, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes took place?
%
\item{}
How many ways can you distribute \(10\) girl scout cookies to \(7\) boy scouts?
%
\item{}
How many anagrams are there of ``anagram''?
%
\item{}
How many subsets of \(\{1,2,3,\ldots, 10\}\) have cardinality \(7\)?
%
\end{itemize}

Before tackling these difficult questions, let's look at the basics of counting.

    Consider this rather simple counting problem: at Red Dogs and Donuts, there are 14 varieties of donuts, and 16 types of hot dogs. If you want either a donut or a dog, how many options do you have? This isn't too hard, you just add 14 and 16. Will that always work? What is important here?
  %
\begin{assemblage}{Additive Principle}\label{assemblage-12}\par\medskip

      The
      \terminology{additive principle}\index{additive principle} states that if event \(A\) can occur in \(m\) ways, and event \(B\) can occur in \(n\)
      \terminology{disjoint}\index{disjoint} ways, then the event ``\(A\) or \(B\)'' can occur in \(m + n\) ways.
    %
\end{assemblage}
\par

    It is important that the events be disjoint: i.e., that there is no way for \(A\) and \(B\) to both happen at the same time. For example, a standard deck of 52 cards contains \(26\) red cards and \(12\) face cards. However, the number of ways to select a card which is either red or a face card is not \(26 + 12 = 38\). This is because there are 6 cards which are both red and face cards.
  %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-23}

        How many two letter ``words''\index{words} start with either A or B? (A word is just a strings of letters; it doesn't have to be English, or even pronounceable.)
      %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        First, how many two letter words start with A? We just need to select the second letter, which can be accomplished in 26 ways. So there are 26 words starting with A. There are also 26 words that start with B. To select a word which starts with either A or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or the second 26, for a total of 52 words.
      %
\end{example}
\par

    The additive principle also works with more than two events. Say, in addition to your 14 choices for donuts and 16 for dogs, you would also consider eating one of 15 waffles? How many choices do you have now? You would have \(14 + 16 + 15 = 45\) options.
  %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-24}

        How many two letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?
      %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        There are 26 two letter words starting with A, another 26 starting with E, and so on. We will have 5 groups of 26. So we add 26 to itself 5 times. Of course it would be easier to just multiply \(5\cdot 26\). We are really using the additive principle again, just using multiplication as a shortcut.
      %
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-25}

        Suppose you are going for some fro-yo. You can pick one of 6 yogurt choices, and one of 4 toppings. How many choices do you have?
      %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        Break your choices up into disjoint events: \(A\) are the choices with the first topping, \(B\) the choices featuring the second topping, and so on. There are four events; each can occur in 6 ways (one for each yogurt flavor). The events are disjoint, so the total number of choices is \(6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24\).
      %
\end{example}
\par

    Note that in both of the previous examples, when using the additive principle on a bunch of events all the same size, it is quicker to multiply. This really is the same, and not just because \(6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 4\cdot 6\). We can first select the topping in 4 ways (that is, we first select which of the disjoint events we will take). For each of those first 4 choices, we now have 6 choices of yogurt. We have:
  %
\begin{assemblage}{Multiplicative Principle}\label{assemblage-13}\par\medskip

      The
      \terminology{multiplicative principle}\index{multiplicative principle} states that if event \(A\) can occur in \(m\) ways, and each possibility for \(A\) allows for exactly \(n\) ways for event \(B\), then the event ``\(A\) and \(B\)'' can occur in \(m \cdot n\) ways.
    %
\end{assemblage}
\par

    The multiplicative principle generalizes to more than two events as well.
  %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-26}

        How many license plates can you make out of three letters followed by three numerical digits?
      %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        Here we have six events: the first letter, the second letter, the third letter, the first digit, the second digit, and the third digit. The first three events can each happen in 26 ways; the last three can each happen in 10 ways. So the total number of license plates will be \(26\cdot 26\cdot 26 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10\), using the multiplicative principle.
      %
\par

        Does this make sense? Think about how we would pick a license plate. How many choices we would have? First, we need to pick the first letter. There are 26 choices. Now for each of those, there are 26 choices for the second letter: 26 second letters with first letter A, 26 second letters with first letter B, and so on. We add 26 to itself 26 times. Or quicker: there are \(26 \cdot 26\) choices for the first two letters.
      %
\par

        Now for each choice of the first two letters, we have 26 choices for the third letter. That is, 26 third letters for the first two letters AA, 26 choices for the third letter after starting AB, and so on. There are \(26 \cdot 26\) of these \(26\) third letter choices, for a total of \((26\cdot26)\cdot 26\) choices for the first three letters. And for each of these \(26\cdot26\cdot26\) choices of letters, we have a bunch of choices for the remaining digits.
      %
\par

        In fact, there are going to be exactly 1000 choices for the numbers. We can see this because there are 1000 three-digit numbers (000 through 999). This is 10 choices for the first digit, 10 for the second, and 10 for the third. The multiplicative principle says we multiply: \(10\cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000\).
      %
\par

        All together, there were \(26^3\) choices for the three letters, and \(10^3\) choices for the numbers, so we have a total of \(26^3 \cdot 10^3\) choices of license plates.
      %
\end{example}
\par

    Careful: ``and'' doesn't mean ``times.'' For example, how many playing cards are both red and a face card? Not \(26 \cdot 12\). The answer is 6, and we needed to know something about cards to answer that question.
  %
\par

    Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more like the multiplicative principle (you are counting two separate events) but the answer is not \(26 \cdot 12\) here either. The problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that \emph{for each} of those there are 12 ways to select the second card. If the first card was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second card.
    \footnote{To solve this problem, you could break it into two cases. First, count how many ways there are to select the two cards when the first card is a red non-face card. Second, count how many ways when the first card is a red face card. Doing so makes the events in each separate case independent, so the multiplicative principle can be applied.\label{fn-1}}

\subsection[Counting With Sets]{Counting With Sets}\label{subsec_countingWithSets}

      Do you believe the additive and multiplicative principles? How would you convince someone they are correct? This is surprisingly difficult. They seem so simple, so obvious. But why do they work?
    %
\par

      To make things clearer, and more mathematically rigorous, we will use sets. Do not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying to give a proof of these principles, but we are doing a lot more. If we understand the additive and multiplicative principles rigorously, we will be better at applying them, and knowing when and when not to apply them at all.
    %
\par

      We will look at the additive and multiplicative principles in a slightly different way. Instead of thinking about event \(A\) and event \(B\), we want to think of a set \(A\) and a set \(B\). The sets will contain all the different ways the event can happen. (It will be helpful to be able to switch back and forth between these two models when checking that we have counted correctly.) Here's what we mean:
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-27}

          Suppose you own 9 shirts and 5 pairs of pants.
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-378}{}
              How many outfits can you make?
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-379}{}
              If today is half-naked-day, and you will wear only a shirt or only a pair of pants, how many choices do you have?
            %
\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          By now you should agree that the answer to the first question is \(9 \cdot 5 = 45\) and the answer to the second question is \(9 + 5 = 14\). These are the multiplicative and additive principles. There are two events: picking a shirt and picking a pair of pants. The first event can happen in 9 ways and the second event can happen in 5 ways. To get both a shirt and a pair of pants, you multiply. To get just one article of clothing, you add.
        %
\par

          Now look at this using sets. There are two sets, call them \(S\) and \(P\). The set \(S\) contains all 9 shirts so \(|S| = 9\) while \(|P| = 5\), since there are 5 elements in the set \(P\) (namely your 5 pairs of pants). What are we asking in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want \(|S \cup P|\), the number of elements in the union of shirts and pants. This is just \(|S| + |P|\) (since there is no overlap; \(|S \cap P| = 0\)). Question 1 is slightly more complicated. Your first guess might be to find \(|S \cap P|\), but this is not right (there is nothing in the intersection). We are not asking for how many clothing items are both a shirt and a pair of pants. Instead, we want one of each. We could think of this as asking how many pairs \((x,y)\) there are, where \(x\) is a shirt and \(y\) is a pair of pants. As we will soon verify, this number is \(|S| \cdot |P|\).
        %
\end{example}
\par

      From this example we can see right away how to rephrase our additive principle in terms of sets:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Additive Principle (with sets)}\label{assemblage-14}\par\medskip

        \index{additive principle} Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), if \(A \cap B = \emptyset\) (that is, if there is no element in common to both \(A\) and \(B\)), then
        \begin{equation*}
          \card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B}.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      This hardly needs a proof. To find \(A \cup B\), you take everything in \(A\) and throw in everything in \(B\). Since there is no element in both sets already, you will have \(\card{A}\) things and add \(\card{B}\) new things to it. This is what adding does! Of course, we can easily extend this to any number of disjoint sets.
    %
\par

      From the example above, we see that in order to investigate the multiplicative principle carefully, we need to consider ordered pairs. We should define this carefully:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Cartesian Product}\label{assemblage-15}\par\medskip

        Given sets \(A\) and \(B\), we can form the
        \terminology{set} \(A \times B = \{(x,y) \st x \in A \wedge y \in B\}\) to be the set of all ordered pairs \((x,y)\) where \(x\) is an element of \(A\) and \(y\) is an element of \(B\). We call \(A \times B\) the
        \terminology{Cartesian product}\index{Cartesian product} of \(A\) and \(B\).
      %
\end{assemblage}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-28}

          Let \(A = \{1,2\}\) and \(B=\{3,4,5\}\). Find \(A \times B\).
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        We want to find ordered pairs \((a,b)\) where \(a\) can be either \(1\) or \(2\) and \(b\) can be either 3, 4, or 5. \(A \times B\) is the set of all of these pairs:
        \begin{equation*}
          A \times B = \{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\}
        \end{equation*}\end{example}
\par

      The question is, what is \(\card{A \times B}\)? To figure this out, write out \(A \times B\).
    %
\par

      Let \(A = \{a_1,a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_m\}\) and \(B = \{b_1,b_2, b_3, \ldots, b_n\}\) (so \(\card{A} = m\) and \(\card{B} = n\)). The set \(A \times B\) contains all pairs with the first half of the pair being some \(a_i \in A\) and the second being one of the \(b_j \in B\). In other words:
      \begin{align*}
 A \times B = \{ \amp (a_1, b_1), (a_1, b_2), (a_1, b_3), \ldots (a_1, b_n),\\
 \amp (a_2, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_2, b_3), \ldots, (a_2, b_n),\\
 \amp (a_3, b_1), (a_3, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots, (a_3, b_n),\\
 \amp \vdots\\
 \amp (a_m, b_1), (a_m, b_2), (a_m, b_3), \ldots, (a_m, b_n)\}.
\end{align*}
    %
\par

      Notice what we have done here: we made \(m\) rows of \(n\) pairs, for a total of \(m \cdot n\) pairs.
    %
\par

      Each row above is really \(\{a_i\} \times B\) for some \(a_i \in A\). That is, we fixed the \(A\)-element. Broken up this way, we have
      \begin{equation*}
        A \times B = (\{a_1\} \times B) \cup (\{a_2\} \times B) \cup (\{a_3\}\times B) \cup \cdots \cup (\{a_m\} \times B).
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      So \(A \times B\) is really the union of \(m\) disjoint sets. Each of those sets has \(n\) elements in them. The total (using the additive principle) is \(n + n + n + \cdots + n = m \cdot n\).
    %
\par

      To summarize:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Multiplicative Principle (with sets)}\label{assemblage-16}\par\medskip

        \index{multiplicative principle} Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), we have \(\card{A \times B} = \card{A} \cdot \card{B}\).
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      Again, we can easily extend this to any number of sets.

\subsection[Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion]{Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion}\label{sec_PIE}
\begin{investigation}[]\label{investigation-6}
 A recent buzz marketing campaign for \emph{Village Inn} surveyed patrons on their pie preferences. People were asked whether they enjoyed (A) Apple, (B) Blueberry or (C) Cherry pie (respondents answered yes or no to each type of pie, and could say yes to more than one type). The following table shows the results of the survey.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
\multicolumn{1}{rA}{Pies enjoyed:}&A&B&C&AB&AC&BC&ABC\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{rA}{Number of people:}&20&13&26&9&15&7&5
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

        How many of those asked enjoy at least one of the kinds of pie? Also, explain why the answer is not 95.
      %
\end{investigation}

      \index{principle of inclusion/exclusion}\index{PIE} While we are thinking about sets, consider what happens to the additive principle when the sets are NOT disjoint. Suppose we want to find \(\card{A \cup B}\) and know that \(\card{A} = 10\) and \(\card{B} = 8\). This is not enough information though. We do not know how many of the 8 elements in \(B\) are also elements of \(A\). However, if we also know that \(\card{A \cap B} = 6\), then we can say exactly how many elements are in \(A\), and, of those, how many are in \(B\) and how many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in \(B\), so 4 are in \(A\) but not in \(B\)). We could fill in a Venn diagram \index{Venn diagram} as follows:
    %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
       \begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thick] \circleA \circleAlabel \circleB \circleBlabel \twosetbox;
  \draw (0,0) node{6} (-1,0) node{4} (1,0) node{2};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

      This says there are 6 elements in \(A \cap B\), 4 elements in \(A \setminus B\) and 2 elements in \(B \setminus A\). Now \emph{these} three sets \emph{are} disjoint, so we can use the additive principle to find the number of elements in \(A \cup B\). It is \(6 + 4 + 2 = 12\).
    %
\par

      This will always work, but drawing a Venn diagram is more than we need to do. In fact, it would be nice to relate this problem to the case where \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint. Is there one rule we can make that works in either case?
    %
\par

      Here is another way to get the answer to the problem above. Start by just adding \(\card{A} + \card{B}\). This is \(10 + 8 = 18\), which would be the answer if \(\card{A \cap B} = 0\). We see that we are off by exactly 6, which just so happens to be \(\card{A \cap B}\). So perhaps we guess,
      \begin{equation*}
        \card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A \cap B}.
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      This works for this one example. Will it always work? Think about what we are doing here. We want to know how many things are either in \(A\) or \(B\) (or both). We can throw in everything in \(A\), and everything in \(B\). This would give \(\card{A} + \card{B}\) many elements. But of course when you actually take the union, you do not repeat elements that are in both. So far we have counted every element in \(A \cap B\) exactly twice: once when we put in the elements from \(A\) and once when we included the elements from \(B\). We correct by subtracting out the number of elements we have counted twice. So we added them in twice, subtracted once, leaving them counted only one time.
    %
\par

      In other words, we have:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Cardinality of a union (2 sets)}\label{assemblage-17}\par\medskip

        For any finite sets \(A\) and \(B\),
        \begin{equation*}
          \card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A \cap B}.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      We can do something similar with three sets.
    %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-29}

          An examination in three subjects, Algebra, Biology, and Chemistry, was taken by 41 students. The following table shows how many students failed in each single subject and in their various combinations:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{A}{Subject:}&A&B&C&AB&AC&BC&ABC\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{rA}{Failed:}&12&5&8&2&6&3&1\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par

          How many students failed at least one subject?
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          The answer is not 37, even though the sum of the numbers above is 37. For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2 of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemestry, and 1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as the elements of the set \(A\), and similarly for sets \(B\) and \(C\). The one student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set \(A \cap B \cap C\). Thus, in Venn diagrams:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
           \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
  \draw[thick] \circleA \circleAlabel \circleB \circleBlabel \circleC \circleClabel \threesetbox;
  \draw (0,-.35) node{1};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

          Now let's fill in the other intersections. We know \(A\cap B\) contains 2 elements, but 1 element has already been counted. So we should put a 1 in the region where \(A\) and \(B\) intersect (but \(C\) does not). Similarly, we calculate the cardinality of \((A\cap C) \setminus B\), and \((B \cap C) \setminus A\):
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
           \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
  \draw[thick] \circleA \circleAlabel \circleB \circleBlabel \circleC \circleClabel \threesetbox;
  \draw (0,-.35) node{1} (0,.4) node{1} (-.6,-.65) node{5} (.6,-.65) node{2};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

          Next, we determine the numbers which should go in the remaining regions, including outside of all three circles. This last number is the number of students who did not fail any subject:
        %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
           \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
  \draw[thick] \circleA \circleAlabel \circleB \circleBlabel \circleC \circleClabel \threesetbox;
  \draw (0,-.35) node{1} (0,.4) node{1} (-.6,-.65) node{5} (.6,-.65) node{2};
  \draw (-1,.3) node{5} (1,.3) node{1} (0,-1.5) node{0} (-1.5,-1.75) node{26};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

          We found 5 goes in the ``\(A\) only'' region because the entire circle for \(A\) needed to have a total of 12, and 7 were already accounted for. Similarly, we calculate the ``\(B\) only'' region to contain only 1 student and the ``\(C\) only'' region to contain no students.
        %
\par

          Thus the number of students who failed at least one class is 15 (the sum of the numbers in each of the eight disjoint regions). The number of students who passed all three classes is 26: the total number of students, 41, less the 15 who failed at least one class.
        %
\par

          Note that we can also answer other questions. For example, now many students failed just Chemistry? None. How many passed Algebra but failed both Biology and Chemistry? This corresponds to the region inside both \(B\) and \(C\) but outside of \(A\), containing 2 students.
        %
\end{example}
\par

      Could we have solved the problem above in an algebraic way? While the additive principle generalizes to any number of sets, when we add a third set here, we must be careful. With two sets, we needed to know the cardinalities of \(A\), \(B\), and \(A \cap B\) in order to find the cardinality of \(A \cup B\). With three sets we need more information. There are more ways the sets can combine. Not surprisingly then, the formula for cardinality of the union of three non-disjoint sets is more complicated:
    %
\begin{assemblage}{Cardinality of a union (3 sets)}\label{assemblage-18}\par\medskip

        For any finite sets \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\),
        \begin{equation*}
          \card{A \cup B \cup C} = \card{A} + \card{B} + \card{C} - \card{A \cap B} - \card{A \cap C} - \card{B \cap C} + \card{A \cap B \cap C}
        \end{equation*}
      %
\end{assemblage}
\par

      To determine how many elements are in at least one of \(A\), \(B\), or \(C\) we add up all the elements in each of those sets. However, when we do that, any element in both \(A\) and \(B\) is counted twice. Also, each element in both \(A\) and \(C\) is counted twice, as are elements in \(B\) and \(C\), so we take each of those out of our sum once. But now what about the elements which are in \(A \cap B \cap C\) (in all three sets)? We added them in three times, but also removed them three times. They have not yet been counted. Thus we add those elements back in at the end.
    %
\par

      Returning to our example above, we have \(\card{A} = 12\), \(\card{B} = 5\), \(\card{C} = 8\). We also have \(\card{A \cap B} = 2\), \(\card{A \cap C} = 6\), \(\card{B \cap C} = 3\), and \(\card{A \cap B \cap C} = 1\). Therefore:
      \begin{equation*}
        \card{A \cup B \cup C} = 12 + 5 + 8 - 2 - 6 - 3 + 1 = 15
      \end{equation*}
    %
\par

      This is what we got when we solved the problem using Venn diagrams.
    %
\par

      This process of adding in, then taking out, then adding back in, and so on is called the \emph{Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion}, or simply PIE. We will return to this counting technique later to solve for more complicated problems (involving more than 3 sets).

      %
\par

        First, a simpler question. How many subsets of \(A\) are there total? In other words, what is \(|\pow(A)|\) (the cardinality of the power set of \(A\))? Think about how we would build a subset. We need to decide, for each of the elements of \(A\), whether or not to include the element in our subset. So we need to decide ``yes'' or ``no'' for the element 1. And for each choice we make, we need to decide ``yes'' or ``no'' for the element 2. And so on. For each of the 5 elements, we have 2 choices. Therefore the number of subsets is simply \(2\cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2\cdot 2 = 2^5\) (by the multiplicative principle).
      %
\par

        Of those 32 subsets, how many have 3 elements? This is not obvious. Note that we cannot just use the multiplicative principle. Maybe we want to say we have 2 choices (yes/no) for the first element, 2 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and then only 1 choice for the other two. But what if we said ``no'' to one of the first three elements? Then we would have two choices for the 4th element. What a mess!
      %
\par

        Another (bad) idea: we need to pick three elements to be in our subset. There are 5 elements to choose from. So there are 5 choices for the first element, and for each of those 4 choices for the second, and then 3 for the third (last) element. The multiplicative principle would say then that there are a total of \(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60\) ways to select the 3 element subset. But this cannot be correct (\(60 > 32\) for one thing). One of the outcomes we would get from these choices would be the set \(\{3,2,5\}\), by choosing the element 3 first, then the element 2, then the element 5. Another outcome would be \(\{5,2,3\}\) by choosing the element 5 first, then the element 2, then the element 3. But these are the same set! We can correct this by dividing: for each set of three elements, there are 6 outcomes counted amoung our 60 (since there are 3 choices for which element we list first, 2 for which we list second, and 1 for which we list last). So we expect there to be
        10 3-element subsets of \(A\).
      %
\par

        Is this right? Well, we could list out all 10 of them, being very systematic in doing so, to make sure we don't miss any or list any twice. Or we could try to count how many subsets of \(A\) \emph{don't} have 3 elements in them. How many have no elements? Just 1 (the empty set). How many have 5? Again, just 1. These are the cases in which we say ``no'' to all elements, or ``yes'' to all elements. Okay, what about the subsets which contain a single element? There are 5 of these. We must say ``yes'' to exactly one element, and there are 5 to choose from. This is also the number of subsets containing 4 elements. Those are the ones for which we must say ``no'' to exactly one element.
      %
\par

        So far we have counted 12 of the 32 subsets. We have not yet counted the subsets with cardinality 2 and with cardinality 3. There are a total of 20 subsets left to split up between these two groups. But the number of each must be the same! If we say ``yes'' to exactly two elements, that can be accomplished in exactly the same number of ways as the number of ways we can say ``no'' to exactly two elements. So the number of 2-element subsets is equal to the number of 3-element subsets. Together there are 20 of these subsets, so 10 each.

\subsection[
        Bit Strings
      ]{
        Bit Strings
      }\label{subsection-13}
 ``Bit'' is short for ``binary digit,'' so a bit string is a string of binary digits. The binary digits are simply the numbers 0 and 1. All of the following are bit strings:
      \begin{equation*}
        1001 \quad 0 \quad 1111 \quad 1010101010
      \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        The number of bits (0's or 1's) in the string is the \emph{length} of the string; the strings above have lengths 4, 1, 4, and 10 respectively. We also can ask how many of the bits are 1's. The number of 1's in a bit string is the \emph{weight} of the string; the weights of the above strings are 2, 0, 4, and 5 respectively.
      %
\begin{assemblage}{Bit Strings}\label{assemblage-19}\par\medskip

          \index{bit string}


          \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}
A \(n\)-bit string is a bit string of length \(n\).  That is, it is a string containing \(n\) symbols, each of which is a bit, either 0 or 1.
%
\item{}
The \emph{weight}\index{weight, of a string} of a bit string is the number of 1's in it.
%
\item{}\(\B^n\)\label{notation-5}
 is the \emph{set} of all \(n\)-bit strings.\item{}\(\B^n_k\)\label{notation-6}
 is the set of all \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\).\end{itemize}

        %
\end{assemblage}
\par

        For example, the elements of the set \(\B^3_2\) are the bit strings 011, 101, and 110. Those are the only strings containing three bits exactly two of which are 1's.
      %
\par

        The counting questions: How many bit strings have length 5? How many of those have weight 3? In other words, we are asking for the cardinalities \(|\B^5|\) and \(|\B^5_3|\).
      %
\par

        To find the number of 5-bit strings is straight forward. We have 5 bits, and each can either be a 0 or a 1. So there are 2 choices for the first bit, 2 choices for the second, and so on. By the multiplicative principle, there are \(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^5 = 32\) such strings.
      %
\par

        Finding the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is harder. Think about how such a string could start. The first bit must be either a 0 or a 1. In the first case (the string starts with a 0), we must then decide on four more bits. To have a total of three 1's, among those four remaining bits there must be three 1's. To count all of these strings, we must include all 4-bit strings of weight 3. In the second case (the string starts with a 1), we still have four bits to choose, but now only two of them can be 1's, so we should look at all the 4-bit strings of weight 2. So the strings in \(\B^5_3\) all have the form \(1\B^4_2\) (that is, a 1 followed by a string from \(\B^4_2\)) or \(0\B^4_3\). These two sets are disjoint, so we can use the additive principle:
        \begin{equation*}
          |\B^5_3| = |\B^4_2| + |\B^4_3|.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        This is an example of a \emph{recurrence relation}. We represented one instance of our counting problem in terms of two simpler instances of the problem. If only we knew the cardinalities of \(\B^4_2\) and \(\B^4_3\). Repeating the same reasoning,
        \begin{equation*}
          |\B^4_2| = |\B^3_1| + |\B^3_2| \quad \mbox{and} \quad |\B^4_3| = |\B^3_2| + |\B^3_3|.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        We can keep going down, but this should be good enough. Both \(\B^3_1\) and \(\B^3_2\) contain 3 bit strings: we must pick one of the three bits to be a 1 (three ways to do that) or one of the three bits to be a 0 (three ways to do that). Also, \(\B^3_3\) contains just one string: 111. Thus \(|\B^4_2| = 6\) and \(|\B^4_3| = 4\), which puts \(\B^5_3\) at a total of 10 strings.
      %
\par

        But wait
        \textemdash{}32 and 10 were the answers to the counting questions about subsets. Coincidence? Not at all. Each bit string can be thought of as a \emph{code} for a subset. For the set \(A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}\), we would use 5-bit strings, one bit for each element of \(A\). Each bit in the string is a 0 if its corresponding element of \(A\) is not in the subset, and a 1 if the element of \(A\) is in the subset. Remember, deciding the subset amounted to a sequence of five yes/no votes for the elements of \(A\). Instead of yes, we put a 1; instead of no, we put a 0.
      %
\par

        For example, the bit string \(11001\) represents the subset \(\{1,2,5\}\) since the first, second and fifth bits are 1's. The subset \(\{3,5\}\) would be coded by the string \(00101\). What we really have here is a bijection from \(\pow(A)\) to \(\B^5\).
      %
\par

        Now for a subset to contain exactly three elements, the corresponding bit string must contain exactly three 1's. In other words, the weight must be 3. Thus counting the number of 3-element subsets of \(A\) is the same as counting the number 5-bit strings of weight 3.

\subsection[ Lattice Paths]{ Lattice Paths}\label{subsection-14}

        The \emph{integer lattice} is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane for which both the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates are integers. If you like to draw graphs on graph paper, the lattice is the set of all the intersections of the grid lines.
      %
\par

        A \emph{lattice path}\index{lattice path} is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice, moving only horizontally and vertically. For example, here are three possible lattice paths from the points \((0,0)\) to \((3,2)\):

        Notice to ensure the path is the \emph{shortest} possible, each move must be either to the right or up. Additionally, in this case, note that no matter what path we take, we must make three steps right and two steps up. No matter what order we make these steps, there will always be 5 steps. Thus each path has \terminology{length} 5.
      %
\par

        The counting question: how many lattice paths are there between \((0,0)\) and \((3,2)\)? We could try to draw all of these, or instead of drawing them, maybe just list which direction we travel on each of the 5 steps. One path might be RRUUR, or maybe UURRR, or perhaps RURRU (those correspond to the three paths drawn above). So how many such strings of R's and U's are there?
      %
\par

        Notice that each of these strings must contain 5 symbols. Exactly 3 of them must be R's (since our destination is 3 units to the right). This seems awfully familiar. In fact, what if we used \(1\)'s instead of R's and 0's instead of U's? Then we would just have 5-bit strings of weight 3. There are 10 of those, so there are 10 lattice paths from (0,0) to (3,2).
      %
\par

        The correspondence between bit strings and lattice paths does not stop there. Here is another way to count lattice paths. Consider the lattice shown below:
      %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
      \begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[very thin, color=gray!50] (-.5,-.5) grid (3.5, 2.5);
  \foreach \x in {0,...,3}
  \foreach \y in {0,...,2}
  \fill (\x,\y) circle (1.5pt);
  \draw (0,0) node[below left] { (0,0)} (3,2) node[above right] { (3,2)};
  \draw (3,1) node[above right] { \(B\)} (2,2) node[above right]{ \(A\)};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

        Any lattice path from (0,0) to (3,2) must pass through exactly one of \(A\) and \(B\). The point \(A\) is 4 steps away from (0,0) and two of them are towards the right. The number of lattice paths to \(A\) is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 2, namely 6. The point \(B\) is 4 steps away from (0,0), but now 3 of them are towards the right. So the number of paths to point \(B\) is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3, namely 4. So the total number of paths to (3,2) is just \(6+4\). This is the same way we calculated the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3. The point: the exact same recurrence relation exists for bit strings and for lattice paths.

\typeout{Subsection 2.2.4 Binomial Coefficients}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Binomial Coefficients]{Binomial Coefficients}\label{subsection-15}

        Binomial coefficients are the coefficients in the expanded version of a binomial, such as \((x+y)^5\). What happens when we multiply such a binomial out? We will expand \((x+y)^n\) for various values of \(n\). Each of these are done by multiplying everything out (i.e., FOIL-ing) and then collecting like terms.
        \begin{equation*}
          (x+y)^1 = x + y
        \end{equation*}
      %
\begin{equation*}
        (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
      \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
        (x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3
      \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
        (x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4.
      \end{equation*}\par

        In fact, there is a quicker way to expand the above binomials. For example, consider the next one, \((x+y)^5\). What we are really doing is multiplying out,
        \begin{equation*}
          (x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y).
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par
If that looks daunting, go back to the case of \((x+y)^3 = (x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\). Why do we only have one \(x^3\) and \(y^3\) but three \(x^2y\) and \(xy^2\) terms? Every time we distribute over an \((x+y)\) we create two copies of what is left, one multiplied by \(x\), the other multiplied by \(y\). To get \(x^3\), we need to pick the ``multiplied by \(x\)'' side every time (we don't have any \(y\)'s in the term). This will only happen once. On the other hand, to get \(x^2y\) we need to select the \(x\) side twice and the \(y\) side once. In other words, we need to pick one of the three \((x+y)\) terms to ``contribute'' their \(y\).
      %
\par

        Similarly, in the expansion of \((x+y)^5\), there will be only one \(x^5\) term and one \(y^5\) term. This is because to get an \(x^5\), we need to use the \(x\) term in each of the copies of the binomial \((x+y)\), and similarly for \(y^5\). What about \(x^4y\)? To get terms like this, we need to use four \(x\)'s and one \(y\), so we need exactly one of the five binomials to contribute a \(y\). There are 5 choices for this, so there are 5 ways to get \(x^4y\), so the coefficient of \(x^4y\) is 5. This is also the coefficient for \(xy^4\) for the same (but opposite) reason: there are 5 ways to pick which of the 5 binomials contribute the single \(x\). So far we have
        \begin{equation*}
          (x+y)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4y + \underline{~?~}~x^3y^2 + \underline{~?~}~x^2y^3 + 5 xy^4 + y^5.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        We still need the coefficients of \(x^3y^2\) and \(x^2y^3\). In both cases, we need to pick exactly 3 of the 5 binomials to contribute one variable, the other two to contribute the other. Wait. This sounds familiar. We have 5 things, each can be one of two things, and we need a total of 3 of one of them. That's just like taking 5 bits and making sure exactly 3 of them are 1's. So the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) (and also \(x^2y^3\)) will be exactly the same as the number of bit strings of length 5 and weight 3, which we found earlier to be 10. So we have:
        \begin{equation*}
          (x+y)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5 xy^4 + y^5.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        These numbers we keep seeing over and over again. They are the number of subsets of a particular size, the number of bit strings of a particular weight, the number of lattice paths, and the coefficients of these binomial products. We will call them \emph{binomial coefficients}. We even have a special symbol for them: \({n \choose k}\).
      %
\begin{assemblage}{Binomial Coefficients}\label{assemblage-20}\par\medskip

          \index{binomial coefficients} For each integer \(n \ge 0\) and integer \(k\) with \(0 \le k \le n\) there is a number
          \begin{equation*}
            {n\choose k}
          \end{equation*}
          read ``\(n\) choose \(k\).'' We have:


          \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\({n\choose k} = |\B^n_k|\), the number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\).\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of subsets of a set of size \(n\) each with cardinality \(k\).\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of lattice paths of length \(n\) containing \(k\) steps to the right.\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the coefficient of \(x^ky^{n-k}\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^n\).\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of ways to select \(k\) objects from a total of \(n\) objects.\end{itemize}

        %
\end{assemblage}
\par

        The last bullet point is usually taken as the definition of \({n \choose k}\). Out of \(n\) objects we must choose \(k\) of them, so there are \(n\) choose \(k\) ways of doing this. Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way:
      %
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}
How many subsets of \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) contain exactly 3 elements?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 elements to be in our subset.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such subsets.
%
\item{}
How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 bits to be 1's.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such bit strings.
%
\item{}
How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such lattice paths.
%
\item{}
What is the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^5\)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute an \(x\).  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so the coefficient is \({5 \choose 3}\).
%
\end{itemize}
\par

        It should be clear that in each case above, we have the right answer. All we had to do is phrase the question correctly and it became obvious that \({5 \choose 3}\) is correct. However, this does not tell us that the answer is in fact 10 in each case. We will eventually find a formula for \({n \choose k}\), but for now, look back at how we arrived at the answer 10 in our counting problems above. It all came down to bit strings, and we have a recurrence relation for bit strings:
        \begin{equation*}
          |\B^n_k| = |\B^{n-1}_{k-1}| + |\B^{n-1}_k|.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        Remember, this is because we can start the bit string with either a 1 or a 0. In both cases, we have \(n-1\) more bits to pick. The strings starting with 1 must contain \(k-1\) more 1's, while the strings starting with 0 still need \(k\) more 1's.
      %
\par

        Since \(|\B^n_k| = {n \choose k}\), the same recurrence relation holds for binomial coefficients:
      %
\begin{assemblage}{Recurrence relation for \({n \choose k}\)}\label{assemblage-21}\par\medskip

          \begin{equation*}
            {n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}

      %
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
{
        \begin{tikzpicture}
  \foreach \n in {0,...,4}
  \foreach \k in {0,...,\n}
  \draw (-\n+2*\k, -\n) node {\(\displaystyle{\n \choose \k}\)};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}
\par

        This can continue as far down as we like. The recurrence relation for \({n \choose k}\) tells us that each entry in the triangle is the sum of the two entries above it. The entries on the sides of the triangle are always 1. This is because \({n \choose 0} = 1\) for all \(n\) since there is only one way to pick 0 of \(n\) objects and \({n \choose n} = 1\) since there is one way to select all \(n\) out of \(n\) objects. Using the recurrence relation, and the fact that the sides of the triangle are 1's, we can easily replace all the entries above with the correct values of \({n \choose k}\). Doing so gives us \emph{Pascal's triangle}.
      %
\par

        We can use Pascal's triangle to calculate binomial coefficients. For example, using the triangle on the next page, we can find \({12 \choose 6} = 924\).

\end{investigation}

    A \terminology{permutation} is a (possible) rearrangement of objects. For example, there are 6 permutations of the letters \emph{a, b, c}:
    \begin{equation*}
      abc, ~~ acb, ~~ bac, ~~bca, ~~ cab, ~~ cba.
    \end{equation*}
  %
\par

    We know that we have them all listed above
    \textemdash{}there are 3 choices for which letter we put first, then 2 choices for which letter comes next, which leaves only 1 choice for the last letter. The multiplicative principle says we multiply \(3\cdot 2 \cdot 1\).
  %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-30}

        How many permutations are there of the letters \emph{a, b, c, d, e, f}?
      %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
        We do NOT want to try to list all of these out. However, if we did, we would need to pick a letter to write down first. There are 6 choices for that letter. For each choice of first letter, there are 5 choices for the second letter (we cannot repeat the first letter; we are rearranging letters and only have one of each), and for each of those, there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter. So there are \(6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 720\) permutations of the 6 letters.
      %
\end{example}
\par
 A piece of notation is helpful here: \(n!\), read ``\(n\) factorial'',\index{factorial} is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \(n\) (for reasons of convenience, we also define 0! to be 1). So the number of permutation of 6 letters, as seen in the previous example is \(6! = 6\cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1\). This generalizes:%
\begin{assemblage}{Permutations of \(n\) elements}\label{assemblage-22}\par\medskip

        There are \(n! = n\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n-2)\cdot \cdots \cdot 2\cdot 1\) permutations of \(n\) (distinct) elements.
      %
\end{assemblage}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-31}

          How many functions \(f:\{1,2,\ldots,8\} \to \{1,2,\ldots, 8\}\) are \emph{bijective}?
        %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
          Remember what it means for a function to be bijective: each element in the codomain must be the image of exactly one element of the domain. Using two line notation, we could write one of these bijections as
          \begin{equation*}
            f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8} {3 \amp 1 \amp 5 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 6 \amp 2 \amp 4}
          \end{equation*}
          What we are really doing is just rearranging the elements of the codomain, so we are creating a permutation of 8 elements. In fact, ``permutation'' is another term used to describe bijective functions from a finite set to itself.
        %
\par

          If you believe this, then you see the answer must be \(8! = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot\cdots\cdot 1 = 40320\). You can see this directly as well: for each element of the domain, we must pick a distinct element of the codomain to map to. There are 8 choices for where to send 1, then 7 choices for where to send 2, and so on. We multiply using the multiplicative principle.
        %
\end{example}
\par

        Sometimes we do not want to permute all of the letters/numbers/elements we are givin.
      %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-32}

            How many 4 letter ``words'' can you make from the letters \emph{a} through \emph{f}, with no repeated letters?
          %
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
            This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters, only now we have more choices for each letter. For the first letter, there are 6 choices. For each of those, there are 5 choices for the second letter. Then there are 4 choices for the third letter, and 3 choices for the last letter. The total number of words is \(6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360\). This is not \(6!\) because we never multiplied by 2 and 1. We could start with \(6!\) and then cancel the 2 and 1, and thus write \(\frac{6!}{2!}\).
          %
\end{example}
\par

        In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of \(k\) objects choosing those objects from a larger collection of \(n\) objects. (In the example above, \(k = 4\), and \(n = 6\).) We write this number \(P(n,k)\) and sometimes call it a \terminology{\(k\)-permutation of \(n\) elements}. From the example above, we see that to compute \(P(n,k)\) we must apply the multiplicative principle to \(k\) numbers, starting with \(n\) and counting backwards. So for example
        \begin{equation*}
          P(10, 4) = 10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        Notice again that \(P(10,4)\) starts out looking like \(10!\), but we stop after 7. We can formally account for this ``stopping'' by dividing away the part of the factorial we do not want:
        \begin{equation*}
          P(10,4) = \frac{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10!}{6!}.
        \end{equation*}
      %
\par

        Careful: The factorial in the denominator is not \(4!\) but rather \((10-4)!\).
      %
\begin{assemblage}{\(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements}\label{assemblage-23}\par\medskip

          \index{\(k\)-permutation}\index{permutation}
          \(P(n,k)\) is the number of \terminology{\(k\)-permutations} of \(n\) elements, the number of ways to \emph{arrange} \(k\) objects chosen from \(n\) distinct objects.
          \begin{equation*}
            P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
          \end{equation*}
        %
\end{assemblage}
\par

        Note that when \(n = k\), we have \(P(n,n) = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = n!\) (since we defined \(0!\) to be 1). This makes sense
        \textemdash{}we already know \(n!\) gives the number of permutations of all \(n\) objects.
      %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-33}
How many functions \(f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}\) are \emph{injective}?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad 
            Note that it doesn't make sense to ask for the number of \emph{bijections} here, as there are none (because the codomain is larger than the domain, there are no surjections). But for a function to be injective, we just can't use an element of the codomain more than once.
          %
\par

            We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image of 1. There are 8 choices. Then we need to pick one of the remaining 7 elements to be the image of 2. Finally, one of the remaining 6 elements must be the image of 3. So the total number of functions is \(8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 = P(8,3)\).
          %
\par

            What this demonstrates in general is that the number of injections \(f:A \to B\), where \(\card{A} = k\) and \(\card{B} = n\), is \(P(n,k)\).
          %
\end{example}
\par

          Here is another way to find the number of \(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements: first select which \(k\) elements will be in the permutation, then count how many ways there are to arrange them. Once you have selected the \(k\) objects, we know there are \(k!\) ways to arrange (permute) them. But how do you select \(k\) objects from the \(n\)? You have \(n\) objects, and you need to \emph{choose} \(k\) of them. You can do that in \({n \choose k}\) ways. Then for each choice of those \(k\) elements, we can permute \emph{them} in \(k!\) ways. Using the multiplicative principle, we get another formula for \(P(n,k)\):
          \begin{equation*}
            P(n,k) = {n \choose k}\cdot k!.
          \end{equation*}
        %
\par

          Now since we have a closed formula for \(P(n,k)\) already, we can substitute that in:
          \begin{equation*}
            \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = {n \choose k} \cdot k!.
          \end{equation*}
        %
\par

          If we divide both sides by \(k!\) we get a closed formula for \({n \choose k}\).
        %
\begin{assemblage}{Closed formula for \({n \choose k}\)}\label{assemblage-24}\par\medskip

            \begin{equation*}
              {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}
            \end{equation*}
          %
\end{assemblage}
\par

          We say \(P(n,k)\) counts permutations, and \({n \choose k}\) counts \emph{combinations}\index{combination}. The formulas for each are very similar, there is just an extra \(k!\) in the denominator of \({n \choose k}\). That extra \(k!\) accounts for the fact that \({n \choose k}\) does not distinguish between the different orders that the \(k\) objects can appear in. We are just selecting (or choosing) the \(k\) objects, not arranging them. Perhaps ``combination'' is a misleading label. We don't mean it like a combination lock (where the order would definitely matter). Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors
          \textemdash{} you just need to decide which flavors to combine, not the order in which to combine them.
        %
\par

          To further illustrate the connection between combinations and permutations, we close with an example.
        %
\begin{example}[]\label{example-34}

              You decide to have a dinner party. Even though you are incredibly popular and have 14 different friends, you only have enough chairs to invite 6 of them.
            %
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-461}{}
How many choices do you have for which 6 friends to invite?
%
\item\hypertarget{li-462}{}
What if you need to decide not only which friends to invite but also where to seat them along your long table?  How many choices do you have then?
%
\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-463}{}
You must simply choose 6 friends from a group of 14.  This can be done in \({14 \choose 6}\) ways.  We can find this number either by using Pascal's triangle or the closed formula: \(\frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!} = 3003\).
%
\item\hypertarget{li-464}{}
Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14.  So the answer is \(P(14, 6)\), which can be calculated as \(\frac{14!}{8!} = 2192190\).
%
\par

  Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).
%
\end{enumerate}

              How are these numbers related? Notice that \(P(14,6)\) is \emph{much} larger than \({14 \choose 6}\). This makes sense. \({14 \choose 6}\) picks 6 friends, but \(P(14,6)\) arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say exactly how much larger \(P(14,6)\) is. In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly \(6!\) ways. So now we have \(3003\cdot 6!\) choices and that is exactly \(2192190\).
            %
\par

              Alternatively, look at the first problem another way. We want to select 6 out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they are selected in. To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:
              \begin{equation*}
                14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9.
              \end{equation*}
            %
\par

              This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly \(2192190 = P(14,6)\)). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely \(6!\) ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is
              \begin{equation*}
                \frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}.
              \end{equation*}
            %
\par

              Note that another way to write this is
              \begin{equation*}
                \frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!}.
              \end{equation*}
              which is what we had originally.

\item\hypertarget{li-67}{}This is not a statement; it does not make sense to say it is true or false.\item\hypertarget{li-68}{}This is an atomic statement (there are some quantifiers, but no connectives).\item\hypertarget{li-69}{}This is a molecular statement, specifically a disjunction.  Although if we read into it a bit more, what the speaker is really saying is that if the Broncos do not win the super bowl, then he will eat his hat, which would be a conditional.\item\hypertarget{li-70}{}This is a molecular statement, a conditional.\item\hypertarget{li-71}{}This is an atomic statement.  Even though there is an ``or'' in the statement, it would not make sense to consider the two halves of the disjuction.  This is because we quantified \emph{over} the disjunction.  In symbols, we have \(\forall x (x > 1 \imp (P(x) \vee C(x)))\).  If we drop the quantifier, we are not left with a statement, since there is a free variable.\item\hypertarget{li-72}{}This is not a statement, although it certainly looks like one.  Remember that statements must be true or false.  If this sentence were true, that would make it false.  If it were false, that would make it true.  Examples like this are rare and usually arise from some sort of self reference.\end{enumerate}

\item\hypertarget{li-100}{} Yes. The original statement would be false too. %
\item\hypertarget{li-101}{} Nothing. The converse need not be true. %
\item\hypertarget{li-102}{} He does not eat Chinese food. The contrapositive would be true. %

\end{enumerate}
\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{6.}\quad{}
          Hint: of course there are many answers. It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is NOT true. Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways. Some ideas: use necessary and sufficient language, use ``only if,'' consider negations, use ``or else'' language.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item\hypertarget{li-141}{} Any even number plus 2 is an even number. %
\item\hypertarget{li-142}{} For any \(x\) there is a \(y\) such that \(\sin(x) = y\). In other words, every number \(x\) is in the domain of sine. %
\item\hypertarget{li-143}{} For every \(y\) there is an \(x\) such that \(\sin(x) = y\). In other words, every number \(y\) is in the range of sine (which is false). %
\item\hypertarget{li-144}{} For any numbers, if the cubes of two numbers are equal, then the numbers are equal. %
\end{enumerate}
\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{9.}\quad{}
          If \(P(x)\) is true of every \(x\), then in particular it is true of \(x = 0\) (or any fixed element of the universe). So then there is definitely some \(x\) (namely 0) for which \(P(x)\) holds. Thus \(\forall x P(x) \imp \exists x P(x)\) is always true. The converse is not always true though. Consider the predicate \(x = 5\). So \(P(x)\) is true if and only if \(x = 5\). Certainly it is true that \(\exists x P(x)\) (since we can take \(x = 5\)), but false that \(\forall x P(x)\).

\noindent\textbf{10.}\quad{}\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item\hypertarget{li-148}{}
              This says that everything has a square root (every element is the square of something). This is true of the positive real numbers, and also of the complex numbers. It is false of the natural numbers though, as for \(x = 2\) there is no natural number \(y\) such that \(y^2 = 2\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-149}{}
              This asserts that between every pair of numbers there is some number strictly between them. This is true of the rationals (and reals) but false of the integers. If \(x = 1\) and \(y = 2\), then there is nothing we can take for \(z\).
            %
\item\hypertarget{li-150}{}
              Here we are saying that something is between every pair of numbers. For almost every domain, this is false. In fact, if the domain contains \(\{1,2,3, 4\}\), then no matter what we take \(x\) to be, there will be a pair that \(x\) is NOT between. However, the set \(\{1,2,3\}\) as our domain makes the statement true. Let \(x = 2\). Then no matter what \(y\) and \(z\) we pick, if \(y \lt  z\), then 2 is between them.

          No. There must be 5 elements in common to both sets.

But to have \(|A| = |B|\), we would need to exclude the same number of elements from both sets.  Since 5 is odd, we would need to exclude 2.5 elements from each set making \(|A| = |B| = 7.5\) which is impossible.

              \begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-1}{}

                  Let \(x\) and \(y\) be elements of the domain \(\Z\). Assume \(f(x) = f(y)\). If \(x\) and \(y\) are both even, then \(f(x) = x+1\) and \(f(y) = y+1\). Since \(f(x) = f(y)\), we have \(x + 1 = y + 1\) which implies that \(x = y\). Similarly, if \(x\) and \(y\) are both odd, then \(x - 3 = y-3\) so again \(x = y\). The only other possibility is that \(x\) is even an \(y\) is odd (or visa-versa). But then \(x + 1\) would be odd and \(y - 3\) would be even, so it cannot be that \(f(x) = f(y)\). Therefore if \(f(x) = f(y)\) we then have \(x = y\), which proves that \(f\) is injective.

                  Let \(y\) be an element of the codomain \(\Z\). We will show there is an element \(n\) of the domain (\(\Z\)) such that \(f(n) = y\). There are two cases: First, if \(y\) is even, then let \(n = y+3\). Since \(y\) is even, \(n\) is odd, so \(f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y\) as desired. Second, if \(y\) is odd, then let \(n = y-1\). Since \(y\) is odd, \(n\) is even, so \(f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y\) as needed. Therefore \(f\) is surjective.

            Yes, this is a function, if you choose the domain and codomain correctly. The domain will be the set of students, and the codomain will be the set of possible grades.

            Yes, as long as the set of cards is the domain and the set of players is the codomain. The function is not injective because multiple cards go to each player. It is surjective since all players get cards.

\par\smallskip

            This cannot be a function. If the domain were the set of cards, then it is not a function because not every card gets dealt to a player. If the domain were the set of players, it would not be a function because a single player would get mapped to multiple cards. Since this is not a function, it doesn't make sense to say whether it is injective/surjective/bijective.

\item\hypertarget{li-495}{}\(17^{10}\) functions.  There are 17 choices for the image of each element in the domain.\item\hypertarget{li-496}{}\(P(17, 10)\) injective functions.  There are 17 choices for image of the first element of the domain, then only 16 choices for the second, and so on.\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item\hypertarget{li-500}{}\(6^4 = 1296\)functions, since there are six choices of where to send each of the 4 elements of the domain.%
\item\hypertarget{li-501}{}\(P(6, 4) = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360\)functions, since outputs cannot be repeated.%
\item\hypertarget{li-502}{}\({6 \choose 4} = 15\) functions. Since the function must be injective and increasing, we just need to select the four distinct elements of the range from the six elements of the codomain.  Once selected, we must put the smallest as the image of 1, the next smallest as  the image of 2, and so on (doing this does not increase the number of functions, since there is one choice for how this event can occur).  %
