<div class="para">The permutation is in part (b), while the combination is in part (c). At first this seems backwards, since usually we use combinations for when order does not matter. Here it looks like in part (c) that order does matter. The better way to distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different arrangements as different outcomes. In part (c), there is only one arrangement of any set of 5 digits, while in part (b) each set of 5 digits gives <span class="process-math">\(5!\)</span> different outcomes.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_counting-combperm.html#li-797" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
