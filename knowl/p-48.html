<div class="para">We are taking a <em class="emphasis">problem solving</em> approach to discrete mathematics: we will consider a large variety of questions that have a discrete feel to them, and consider how to answer those questions (and prove that our answers are correct).  This is not the only way to study discrete math.  Another approach would be to study the tools used to solve the problems.  We could study paint brushes and easels and the composition of paint, which would be interesting for sure, but I think it is more enjoyable to actually paint and learn how to create pretty little trees.</div>
