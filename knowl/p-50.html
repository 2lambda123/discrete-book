<div class="para"> The tools in our subject are called <dfn class="terminology">discrete structures</dfn>.  They are the mathematical objects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving.  “Structure” is a good word here, since these “things” have fairly rigid constraints that make them what they are, just like an apartment building is going to have different characteristics than an airplane hanger or a suspension bridge (these types of physical structures, not mathematical structures, just to be overly clear and destroy the metaphor).</div>
