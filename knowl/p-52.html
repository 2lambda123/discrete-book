<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">set</dfn> is an <em class="emphasis">unordered</em> collection of elements.  This is fairly vague, but unless we want to spend a whole book trying to understand sets more precisely, it will be good enough for us.  It is possible to define all of mathematics using just sets (even numbers can be thought of as sets themselves), but this is also not what we will do.  Rather, we want to be able to talk about collections of numbers and other objects, and we will collect them in something we call a <dfn class="terminology">set</dfn>.</div>
