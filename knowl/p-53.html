<div class="para">We can describe sets by saying exactly what elements are members of the set.  We could specify this membership in words (e.g., Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be the set of all natural numbers less than 10), or by explicitly listing all the elements (e.g. <span class="process-math">\(A = \{3, 5, 7\}\)</span>) or using something called <dfn class="terminology">set comprehension</dfn> (also called <dfn class="terminology">set builder notation</dfn>).  And example of this is <span class="process-math">\(A = \{x \in \N \st x \lt 10\}\text{.}\)</span>  We would read that as “<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is the set of all natural numbers that satisfy the property that they are less than 10.”  More precisely, the <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span> symbol represents the natural numbers, which is itself a set: <span class="process-math">\(\N = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\)</span> (this shows another way to describe a set). The <span class="process-math">\(\in\)</span> symbol means “is an element of”.  The <span class="process-math">\(\st\)</span> is read “such that” and tells us that what comes next is the <em class="emphasis">condition</em> that must be true of the set's elements.</div>
