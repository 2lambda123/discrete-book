<div class="para">There are lots of things you can <em class="emphasis">do</em> with sets, which we will consider in more detail as we need to.  We will see that it is often helpful to build new sets from ones we already have (by taking the <dfn class="terminology">union</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">intersection</dfn> of sets, for example), to compare sets (asking if one set is a <dfn class="terminology">subset</dfn> of another), and to find the number of elements of a set (called its <dfn class="terminology">cardinality</dfn>).  We might also want to match up elements of one set with another: to do this, we might use a <dfn class="terminology">function</dfn>, which we will discuss next.  Awesomely, we can also use sets themselves to describe functions.  Let's check it out.</div>
