<div class="para">The main thing to realize is that we do not know the colors of these two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a purple triangle and orange diamond.  We could have a triangle that was not purple but a orange diamond.  Or we could have a triangle that was not purple and a diamond that was not orange.  The case in which the triangle is purple but the diamond is not orange cannot occur, as that would make the statement false.</div>
