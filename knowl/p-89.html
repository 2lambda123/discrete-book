<div class="para">Graphs show up in all sorts of real-world applications: in a class, some students are friends with each other, so take the students to be the vertices and the edges to be the friendships.  In geography, some countries share a border, so take the countries to be the vertices and connect a pair of vertices with an edge if the countries share a border.  Perhaps you are planning a trip and want to fly from Denver to Paris.  Is there a direct flight, or do you need to stop in Newark?  That is, does the graph of flights have an edge between Denver and Paris or only between Denver and Newark and between Newark and Paris?  When your Amazon driver delivers packages to 10 houses in your neighborhood, how does her app know in which order to deliver the package?  Graph theory!</div>
