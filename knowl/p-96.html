<div class="para">They key that makes this argument work is the logical form of the statements involved and our agreement about the relationship between those forms and truth.  The first statement has the form “<span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span>”, which in symbols we write <span class="process-math">\(P \vee Q\text{.}\)</span>  We set rules for the conditions under which this <dfn class="terminology">disjunction</dfn> (i.e. “or” statement) is true, depending only on the truth values of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  Similarly, the second statement has the form <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{,}\)</span> which is true precisely when <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true (we will convince ourselves this is the right choice later).</div>
