\begin{questions}

%\question Think back to the legend of the Tower of Hanoi. There was a great hall containing 3 pillars. The monks moved disks one at a time from one pillar to another, taking care not to place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. 
%\begin{itemize} 
%\item[(a)] Find a recursive function for the number of moves it takes to move \emph{n} disks.
%\vfill
%\item[(b)] Solve for a closed form using the Characteristic Root technique.
%\end{itemize}}

\question {\bf Candy Machine}: Think back to the magical candy machine at King Soopers. Suppose that the first time a quarter is put into the machine 1 Skittle comes out. The second time, 4 Skittles, the third time 16 Skittles, the fourth time 64 Skittles, etc.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find both a recursive and closed formula for how many Skittles the \emph{n}th customer gets.
\vfill
\item[(b)] Check your solution for the closed formula by solving the recurrence relation using the Characteristic Root technique.
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\newpage
\question {\bf Colorful Tiles}: You have access to $1 \times 1$ tiles which come in 2 different colors and $1\times 2$ tiles which come in 3 different colors.  We want to figure out how many different $1 \times n$ path designs we can make out of these tiles.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find a recursive definition for the sequence $a_n$ of paths of length $n$.  
\vfill
\vfill
\item[(b)] Solve the recurrence relation using the Characteristic Root technique.
\end{itemize}

%\question {\bf Monochromatic Tiles}: Recall, if we have only one type of each tile, we get the Fibonacci sequence: $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$.  Find a close formula for $F_n$.

%\question What goes wrong if you try to solve the recurrence relation $a_n = 6a_{n-1} - 9a_{n-2}$ with initial conditions $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 4$?  How can we fix this?
