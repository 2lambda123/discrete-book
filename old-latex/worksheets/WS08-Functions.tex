In this activity you are asked to find examples of functions.  In each case, the domain should be $X = \{1,2,3,4\}$.  Your job is to specify a codomain $Y$ and define the function with the given properties.  Your choice of $Y$ can (must) change for each example.
\begin{questions}
\question $f:X \to Y$ is bijective.
\vfill
\question $f:X \to Y$ is injective but not surjective.
\vfill
\question $f:X \to Y$ is surjective but not injective.
\vfill
\question $f:X \to Y$ is neither injective nor surjective.
\vfill
\end{questions}
If you finish early, think about this: for each of the situations above, fixing your choice of $Y$, {\em how many} different examples of $f:X \to Y$ would work?

Want even more?  What different choices of $Y$ could you make in each example?
