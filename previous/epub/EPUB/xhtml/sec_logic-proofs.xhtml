      Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that “Goldbach's Conjecture” holds for all numbers less than \(4\times 10^{18}\), which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).

        <p id="p-1899">
      Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique. Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.

        Suppose this were not the case. That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes. Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it \(p\). Consider the number
        \begin{equation*}
          N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1.

      We should say a bit more about the last line. Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise “there are only finitely many primes” and the conclusion “there is a prime larger than the largest prime.” This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines. So if the premises are true, then the conclusion <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> be true. However, the conclusion is NOT true. The only way out: the premise must be false.

      The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on. Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true. Additionally, it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof. This is where using tools from logic is helpful. Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard proof styles that keep showing up again and again. Being familiar with these can help understand proof, as well as give ideas of how to write your own.

      The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a <em class="terminology">direct proof</em>. Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means. Direct proofs are especially useful when proving implications. The general format to prove \(P \imp Q\) is this:
    </p>
        <blockquote>
      Assume \(P\). Explain, explain,
      …, explain. Therefore \(Q\).
    </blockquote>
        <p id="p-1915">
      Often we want to prove universal statements, perhaps of the form \(\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))\). Again, we will want to assume \(P(x)\) is true and deduce \(Q(x)\). But what about the \(x\)? We want this to work for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all</em> \(x\). We accomplish this by fixing \(x\) to be an arbitrary element (of the sort we are interested in).

      Recall that an implication \(P \imp Q\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\).

          This is the converse of the statement we proved above using a direct proof. From trying a few examples, this statement definitely appears this is true. So let's prove it.

          A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary \(n\) and assuming that \(n^2\) is even. But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about \(n\). Just because \(n^2 = 2k\) does not in itself suggest how we could write \(n\) as a multiple of 2.

                <p id="p-1932">
          Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement. We get, for all integers \(n\), if \(n\) is odd then \(n^2\) is odd. This looks much more promising. Our proof will look something like this:

Now \(n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\). Since \(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^2\) is odd and therefore not even.

          The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to separate \(a\) and \(b\) from knowing something about \(a+b\).

      There might be statements which really cannot be rephrased as implications. For example, “\(\sqrt 2\) is irrational.” In this case, it is hard to know where to start. What can we assume? Well, say we want to prove the statement \(P\). What if we could prove that \(\neg P \imp Q\) where \(Q\) was false? If this implication is true, and \(Q\) is false, what can we say about \(\neg P\)? It must be false as well, which makes \(P\) true!

      This is why <em class="terminology">proof by contradiction</em> works.

          Suppose not. Then \(\sqrt 2\) is equal to a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\). Without loss of generality, assume \(\frac{a}{b}\) is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the fraction). So,

      However, existential statements can be proven this way. If we want to prove that there is an integer \(n\) such that \(n^2-n+41\) is not prime, all we need to do is find one. This might seem like a silly thing to want to prove until you try a few values for \(n\).

    <figure class="figure-like" id="table-37"><table><tr><td class="c m b1 r1 l0 t0">\(n\)</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">1</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">2</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">3</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">4</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">5</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">6</td><td class="c m b1 r0 l0 t0">7</td></tr><tr><td class="c m b0 r1 l0 t0">\(n^2 - n + 41\)</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">41</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">43</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">47</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">53</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">61</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">71</td><td class="c m b0 r0 l0 t0">83</td></tr></table></figure>

      So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture, “For all positive integers \(n\), the number \(n^2 - n + 41\) is prime.” If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>false</em> by proving its negation: “There is a positive integer \(n\) such that \(n^2 - n + 41\) is not prime.” Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.
    </p>
        <p id="p-1962">
      In fact, we can quickly see that \(n = 41\) will give \(41^2\) which is certainly not prime. You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that \(n^2 - n + 41\) is always prime. Since so many statements in mathematics are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.

          \begin{equation*}

                <p id="p-1967">
          As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from \(\forall\) to \(\exists\). We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.

                <p id="p-1968">
          Now we know what to do. To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd, but \(a+b\) is not odd (so even). That's easy: 1 and 3. (remember, “or” means one or the other or both). Both of these are odd, but \(1+3 = 4\) is not odd.

      We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we haven't even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is to prove that \(P\) is true by proving that \(Q \imp P\) and \(\neg Q \imp P\) for some statement \(Q\). So no matter what, whether or not \(Q\) is true, we know that \(P\) is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove \(P\). We know that at least one of the statements \(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n\) are true. If we can show that \(Q_1 \imp P\) and \(Q_2 \imp P\) and so on all the way to \(Q_n \imp P\), then we can conclude \(P\). The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the \(Q_i\)'s) must be true no matter what.

          It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about \(n\). We might be able to prove that \(n^3 - n\) is even if we knew that \(n\) was even. In fact, we could probably prove that \(n^3-n\) was even if \(n\) was odd. But since \(n\) must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.

            We consider two cases: if \(n\) is even or if \(n\) is odd.
          </p>
                  <p id="p-1975">
            Case 1: \(n\) is even. Then \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). This give
            \begin{align*}
 n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k\\
 \amp = 2(4k^2 - k),
\end{align*}
            and since \(4k^2 - k\) is an integer, this says that \(n^3-n\) is even.
          </p>
                  <p id="p-1976">
            Case 2: \(n\) is odd. Then \(n = 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). This gives
            \begin{align*}
 n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)\\
 \amp = 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1\\
 \amp = 2(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k),
\end{align*}
            and since \(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is even again.
          </p>
                  <p id="p-1977">
            Since \(n^3 - n\) is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is indeed always even.

          Suppose you have an \(n\times n\) chessboard but your dog has eaten one of the corner squares. Can you still cover the remaining squares with dominoes? What needs to be true about \(n\)? Give necessary and sufficient conditions (that is, say exactly which values of \(n\) work and which do not work). Prove your answers.

          What if your \(n\times n\) chessboard is missing two opposite corners? Prove that no matter what \(n\) is, you will not be able to cover the remaining squares with dominoes.
