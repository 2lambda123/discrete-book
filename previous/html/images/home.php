<h2>Discrete Textbook</h2>

<p><a href="discretetext">Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</a> is now available to download for free or purchase for cheap.  More information about this open source textbook can be found by clicking the link above.</p>


<h2>Teaching: </h2>
<p>This Spring (2016) I am teaching Supplemental Calculus (Math 130), Discrete Mathematics (Math 228) and  Abstrac Algebra II (Math 322).  Course materials will be available through <a href="http://bb.unco.edu" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>.



<p>I have begun recording videos in which I work out some example problems.  These can be seen on my YouTube channel: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/oscarlevin" target="_blank">Mathematics Exemplified</a>.</p> 

<p>Since arriving at UNC, I taught Discrete Mathematics, Modern Geometry I, Abstract Algebra I and II, Calculus I and II and Topics in Calculus, as well as graduate courses in Logic, Graph Theory, Analysis, and Probability and Statistics.  I have taught a wide variety of courses at Coastal Carolina University and the University of Connecticut as well.  Course websites for most of those classes are available <a href="teaching.php">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My primary interests lie in effective algebra and combinatorics, computability theory, reverse mathematics, and mathematical logic.  Effective algebra endeavors to understand results of algebra and combinatorics from a viewpoint of computability theory.  My Ph.D. dissertation concerns the effective content of ordered fields.  My thesis, along with some other papers I've worked on, are available on my <a href="research.php">research page</a></p>

<h2>Mathematical Puzzles</h2>
<p>I enjoy using mathematical puzzles in teaching.  I have started a collection of the best of these puzzles on what I'm calling the <a href="http://mathpuzzlewiki.com" target="_blank">Math Puzzle Wiki</a>.  If you are a math teacher looking for a good extra credit problem, or simply a puzzle enthusiast, please check it out.  You can even contribute your own puzzles or add to ones already there.
