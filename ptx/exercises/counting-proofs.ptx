                  The question is how many ways can you select one of <m>x</m> fezzes and one of <m>y</m> bow ties. We answer this question in two ways. First, the answer could be <m>a\cdot b</m>. This is correct as described in part (a) above. Second, the answer could be <m>{x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2}</m>. This is correct as described in part (b) above. Therefore

      </hint>
      <solution category="instructor">
        <p>
          There are 120 triangles.
          Here are a few ways
          (there are others as well)
          to get this:

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                First count the triangles with the base on the <m>x</m> -axis.
                There are <m>{7 \choose 2}</m> ways to pick the base.
                The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the <m>y</m> -axis
                (not the origin)
                so there are a total of <m>{7 \choose 2}4</m> of these triangles.
                The triangles with base on the <m>y</m> axis can be counted similarly:
                <m>{5 \choose 2}6</m>.
                However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the <m>x</m> -axis and also on the <m>y</m> -axis.
                There are <m>4 \cdot 6</m> right triangles.
                Thus the total number of triangles is:
                <me>
                  {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
                </me>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                First count all the right triangles: <m>6 \cdot 4</m>.
                Then count all the non-right triangles with two vertices on the <m>x</m> -axis:
                <m>4 \cdot {6 \choose 2}</m>.
                Finally, the number of non-right triangles with two vertices on the <m>y</m> -axis:
                <m>6 \cdot {4 \choose 2}</m>.
                All together then we have <m>{6 \choose 2}4 + {4 \choose 2}6 + 6 \cdot 4 = 120</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Another approach to count the non-right triangles is to first select one of the two sides not parallel to an axis.
                This can be done in <m>6 \cdot 4</m> ways.
                Then for each of these, select one of the remaining 8 points,
                which determines the triangle.
                However, this double counts the non-right triangles,
                so we take <m>\frac{4\cdot 6 \cdot 8}{2}</m>,
                and then add on the <m>6\cdot 4</m> right triangles.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                We must select 3 of the 11 dots.
                This can be done in <m>{11 \choose 3}</m> ways.
                However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the <m>x</m> -axis or on the <m>y</m> -axis.
                There are <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>x</m> -axis.
                There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>y</m> -axis.
                Therefore the total number of triangles is
                <me>
                  {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = 120
                </me>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Picking two of these, we know the expressions must be equal
          (and not just because they are equal to 120).
          So we might write:
          <me>
            {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          In general, suppose we have <m>m</m> dots on the <m>x</m> -axis
          (including the origin)
          and <m>n</m> dots on the <m>y</m> -axis
          (including the origin).
          Then counting the number of triangles in two different ways establishes:
          <me>
            {m+n \choose 3} - {m \choose 3} - {n \choose 3} = {m \choose 2}(n-1) + {n \choose 2}(m-1) - (m-1)(n-1)
          </me>

          An so on, all the way up to the largest the middle number could be,
          which is <m>n+1</m>.
          In that case there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and
          <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top number.
          Thus the number of 5 element subsets is
          <me permid="Oqe">
            {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2}

          Since the two answers correctly answer the same question, we have

    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="ex-comb-proof-rowsum"/> we established that the sum of any row in Pascal's triangle is a power of two.  Specifically,
        <me>
          {n\choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + {n\choose 2} + \cdots + {n \choose n} = 2^n
        </me>.
        The argument given there used the counting question, <q>how many pizzas can you build using any number of <m>n</m> different toppings?</q>  To practice, give new proofs of this identity using different questions.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use a question about counting subsets.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use a question about counting bit strings.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use a question about counting lattice paths.

    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For the lattice paths, think about what sort of paths <m>2^n</m> would count.  Not all the paths will end at the same point, but you could describe the set of end points as a line.
