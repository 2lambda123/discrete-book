        We will prove the contrapositive:
        if <m>n</m> is even, then <m>5n</m> is even.
      </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer,
          and suppose <m>n</m> is even.
          Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
          Thus <m>5n = 5\cdot 2k = 10k = 2(5k)</m>.
          Since <m>5k</m> is an integer,
          we see that <m>5n</m> must be even.
          This completes the proof.

        then I can cover the above chessboard.
        To prove this, I am going to first notice that if I take away the column and row attached to the missing square, I have created an
        <m>n-1\times n-1</m> chessboard where <m>n-1</m> is even.
        By the proof in class,
        we have shown that that can be completely covered with dominoes.
        So, now I just need to worry about the row and column I took away.
        Since <m>n</m> is odd, I know that the row and column are even and thus can be covered by dominoes lined up head to tail.
        Thus, I have shown that if <m>n</m> is odd then I can completely cover an
        <m>n\times n</m> chessboard if <m>n</m> is odd.

      <p>
        First notice that both removed squares have identical color.
        So their removal leaves us with
        <m>\frac{n}{2}</m> squares of one color and
        <m>\frac{n-2}{2}</m> squares of the other color.
        Since a domino always covers one black and one white squares,
        the remaining squares cannot be tiled.
