              <p>
                <m>f(1) = 4</m>, since <m>4</m> is the number below 1 in the two-line notation.

            <li>
              <p>
                Such an <m>n</m> is <m>n= 2</m>, since <m>f(2) = 1</m>.  Note that 2 is above a 1 in the notation.

              <p>
                <m>n = 4</m> has this property.  We say that 4 is a <term>fixed point</term> of <m>f</m>.  Not all functions have such a point.

              <p>
                Such an element is 2 (in fact, that is the only element in the codomain that is not in the range).  In other words, 2 is not the image of any element under <m>f</m>; nothing is sent to 2.

              This is neither injective nor surjective.  It is not injective because more than one element from the domain has 3 as its image.  It is not surjective because there are elements of the codomain (1, 2, 4, and 5) that are not images of anything from the domain.

          <li>
            <p>
              This is a bijection.  Every element in the codomain is the image of <em>exactly</em> one element of the domain.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This is a bijection.  Note that we can write this function in two line notation as <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{5 \amp 4 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 1}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              In two line notation, this function is <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{1 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 2 \amp 3}</m>.  From this we can quickly see it is neither injective (for example, 1 is the image of both 1 and 2) nor surjective (for example, 4 is not the image of anything).

              This is neither injective nor surjective.  It is not injective because more than one element from the domain has 1 as its image.  It is not surjective because 3 is an element of the codomain but not the range.
