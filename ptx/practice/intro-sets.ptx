              <p>
                This is the set <m>\{3, 4, 5, \ldots \}</m> since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least three more than 2.  Since <m>3^2 - 3 = 6</m> but <m>2^2 - 3 = 1</m> we see that the first such natural number is 3.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Here we don't specify that <m>n</m> must be a whole number at first, but the condition we place on it, that <m>n^2 - 5 \in \N</m> does guarantee this (since square a non-integer always gives a non-integer, as does subtracting 5 from a non-integer).  So in fact, we get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which <m>n^2 - 5</m> is a natural numbers is 3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that if we didn't specify <m>n \ge 0</m> then any integer less than <m>-3</m> would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This is the set <m>\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}</m>, namely the set of numbers that are the <em>result</em> of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number.  (<m>0^2 + 1 = 1</m>, <m>1^2 + 1 = 2</m>, <m>2^2 + 1 = 5</m> and so on.)  Thus the least element of the set is 1.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 1.  That is, <m>\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}</m>, the same set as the previous part.  So again, the least element is 1.

          <li> <p> 103. Again, you could compute this by <m>100-(-2)+1</m>, or simply count: 100 numbers from 1 through 100, plus -2, -1, and 0.</p> </li>
