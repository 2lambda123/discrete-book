        Each of the counting problems below can be solved with stars and bars.
        For each, say what outcome the diagram
        <me permid="Hzz">
          ***|*||**|
        </me>
        represents, if there are the correct number of stars and bars for the problem.
        Otherwise, say why the diagram does not represent any outcome,
        and what a correct diagram would look like.

              This is backwards.
              We don't want the stars to represent the kids because the kids are not identical,
              but the stars are.
              Instead we should use 5 stars
              (for the lollipops)
              and use 5 bars to switch between the 6 kids.
              For example,
              <me permid="nGI">
                **||***|||
              </me>
              would
              represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops,
              the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.
            </p>
          </li>

              This doesn't represent a solution.
              Each star should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should
              <em>switch</em>
              between the different variables.
              We have one too many bars.
              An example of a correct diagram would be
              <me permid="TNR">
                *|**||***
              </me>,

              <m>x_2 = 2</m>,
              <m>x_3 = 0</m>, and
              <m>x_4 = 3</m>.
