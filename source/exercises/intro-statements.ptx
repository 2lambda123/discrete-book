    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the implication, <q>if you clean your room,
        then you can watch TV.</q> Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible.
        Then do the same for the converse.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Of course there are many answers.
        It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is <em>not</em> true.
        Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways.
        Some ideas: Use <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language,
        use <q>only if,</q> consider negations,
        use <q>or else</q> language.

          Consider the statement, <q>For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n</m> is solitary.</q>  You do not need to know what <em>solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which.  Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.

          <p>
            The converse: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is solitary, then <m>n</m> is prime.  The contrapositive: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is not solitary, then <m>n</m> is not prime.

            Write the negation of the original statement.  What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false?

        </statement>
      	<solution>
          <p>
            The negation: There is a natural number <m>n</m> which is prime <em>and</em> not solitary.  So to prove the original statement false, we need to find one example of a number which is prime but not solitary.

      	<solution>
          <p>
            This statement is true.  The hypothesis of the statement is false (10 is not prime), so the implication is automatically true.

            It turns out that 8 is solitary.  Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive?  Explain.
          </p>
        </statement>
      	<solution>
          <p>
            This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).  All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.  However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.

            Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em>set</em> <m>P</m> of prime numbers and the <em>set</em> <m>S</m> of solitary numbers.  Explain.

        </statement>
      	<solution>
          <p>
            We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers.  Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true.
