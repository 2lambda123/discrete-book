<p id="QaA">An <dfn class="terminology">implication</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">conditional</dfn> is a molecular statement of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P \imp Q
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are statements. We say that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="WGK"><p id="p-derived-WGK"><span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">hypothesis</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">antecedent</dfn>).</p></li>
<li id="iVc"><p id="p-derived-iVc"><span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">conclusion</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">consequent</dfn>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="whJ">An implication is <em class="emphasis">true</em> provided <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true (or both), and <em class="emphasis">false</em> otherwise. In particular, the only way for <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> to be false is for <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to be true <em class="emphasis">and</em> <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> to be false.</p></article><p id="eef"> Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the <em class="emphasis">Pythagorean Theorem</em>. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as ‚Äú<span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span>‚Äù This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables? So <span class="process-math">\(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\text{???}\)</span> How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the legs of a right triangle and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the hypotenuse. In other words:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="pPH"><p id="Uaz"><em class="emphasis">If</em> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">then</em> <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span></p></blockquote>
<p id="Klo">This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion (‚Äúthen‚Äù part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis (‚Äúif‚Äù part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-3" id="fn-3"><sup>‚Äâ2‚Äâ</sup></a></p>
<p id="qsx">Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.</p>

<p id="ERB">Consider the statement:</p> <blockquote class="blockquote" id="UhD"><p id="AhI">If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.</p></blockquote> <p id="kYK">This is definitely an implication: <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the statement ‚ÄúBob gets a 90 on the final,‚Äù and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is the statement ‚ÄúBob will pass the class.‚Äù</p> <p id="RfT">Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> was false, and the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> was true. In the first case, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> was true, and so was <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is true when either <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true.</p></article><p id="WzG">Just to be clear, although we sometimes read <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> as ‚Äú<span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> <em class="emphasis">implies</em> <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span>‚Äù, we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> In particular, if you claim that <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">false</em>, you are not saying that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> does not imply <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> but rather that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false.</p>

</div></article><p id="CGP">It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to <em class="emphasis">prove</em> that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.</p>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="hBo"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Direct Proofs of Implications.</span></h3>
<p id="coS">To prove an implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{,}\)</span> it is enough to assume <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and from it, deduce <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></article><p id="iNY">Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> directly, you must explain why <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true, but you <em class="emphasis">get to</em> assume <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true first. After all, you only care about whether <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true in the case that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is as well.</p>
<p id="OVh">There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most elegant style of proof and has the advantage that such a proof often does a great job of explaining <em class="emphasis">why</em> the statement is true.</p>

The proof proceeds essentially by repeatedly asking and answering, ‚Äúwhat does that mean?‚Äù Eventually, we conclude that it means the conclusion.</p>
</div></div>
</div></article><p id="vcq">This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever found yourself starting an argument with ‚Äúhypothetically, let's assume ‚Ä¶,‚Äù then you have attempted a direct proof of your desired conclusion.</p>
<p id="bjz">An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements. It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements. Here we introduce some common language to address this question.</p>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="NIx"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Converse and Contrapositive.</span></h3>
<ul id="Iwb" class="disc">
<li id="Pcl"><p id="izD">The <dfn class="terminology">converse</dfn>  of an implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is the implication <span class="process-math">\(Q \imp P\text{.}\)</span> The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication is true is independent of the truth of the implication.</p></li>
<li id="vju"><p id="OGM">The <dfn class="terminology">contrapositive</dfn>  of an implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is the statement <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q \imp \neg P\text{.}\)</span> An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).</p></li>
</ul></article><p id="HqI">Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.</p>
<p id="nxR">However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{,}\)</span> then the triangle with sides <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a <em class="emphasis">right</em> triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.</p>
<p id="TFa">The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.</p>

<p id="ezE">True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you <em class="emphasis">don't</em> have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).</p> <p id="KGN">The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).</p>
