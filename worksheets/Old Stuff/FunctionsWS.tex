\begin{document}
In each of the problems on this page, find a set $Y$ and a function $f$ satisfying the condition specified.  Then say what must be true of $Y$ for the example to be possible.

\begin{questions}
\question The function $f: \{1,2,3,4\} \to Y$ is one-to-one but not onto.  
\vfill
\question The function $f: \{1,2,3,4\} \to Y$ is onto but not one-to-one.
\vfill
\question The function $f: \{1,2,3,4\} \to Y$ is one-to-one and onto.
\vfill
\question The function $f: \{1,2,3,4\} \to Y$ is neither one-to-one nor onto.

\question For which sets $X$ is it true that if $f: X \to X$ is one-to-one, then $f$ is also onto?
