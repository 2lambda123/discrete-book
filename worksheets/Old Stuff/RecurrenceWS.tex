\begin{questions}
\question Solve the recurrence relations below.  Use telescoping if possible, if not, try iteration.  If that also won't work, use the characteristic root technique.
\begin{parts}
  \part $a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1$ with $a_0 = 0$ (this was the recursion for the Tower of Hanoi).
  \vfill
  \part $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$.
  \vfill
\end{parts}
\newpage

\question {\bf Colorful Tiles}: You have access to $1 \times 1$ tiles which come in 2 different colors and $1\times 2$ tiles which come in 3 different colors.  We want to figure out how many different $1 \times 10$ path designs we can make out of these tiles.
\begin{parts}
  \part Find the first few terms of the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3,\ldots$ where $a_n$ is the number of different $1\times n$ paths designs.  Think about how you can find $a_3$ from $a_2$ and $a_1$.
  \vfill
  \part Find a recursive definition for the sequence.  That is, given a recurrence relation and initial conditions.
  \vfill
  \part Solve the recurrence relation subject to the initial conditions.
  \vfill
  \vfill
  \part How many different $1\times 10$ paths can you design?
\end{parts}
