To give you a feel for the type and variety of questions discrete mathematics can help us solve, here are a few sample problems.
\begin{questions}


  \question While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls.  Each is either a {\em knight}, who always tells the truth, or a {\em knave}, who always lies.  The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave.  Each troll makes a single statement:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item[] Troll 1: Only one of us is a knight.
   \item[] Troll 2: No, only one of use is a knave.
   \item[] Troll 3: We are all knaves.
  \end{itemize}
  Which troll is which?
  
  \question Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to build roads connecting each pair of towns. While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long as they wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each other (as stop signs had not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed. Is it possible for each of these town to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections? 
  
  \question You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need.  You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps.  Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps?  Which amounts are impossible to make?
  
  \question A frog intends to hop up a 10 step staircase.  On each hop, the frog can jump up 1 or 2 steps.  In how many different ways can the frog make it to the top?  (One way: 1 step then 2 steps then 2 steps then 1 step then 1 step then 2 steps then 1 step. If he started with 2 steps first, that would be a different way.)
  
  \question Bruce and Sam find themselves by a fountain with only two empty water bottles - one can hold exactly 3 gallons, the other exactly 5 gallons.  They know that they must somehow measure 4 gallons of water, else catastrophe strikes.  How can they accomplish their task?

\end{questions}
