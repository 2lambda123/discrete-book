\subsection*{Activity 1: Odds are\ldots awesome}
Our goal: find a nice formula for the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers.
\begin{questions}
  \question First, find the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers for small values of $n$.  Fill in the missing bits below:
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{parts} 
      \part $n = 1$: $1 = \underline{1}$
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 2$: $1 + 3 = $
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 3$: $1 + 3 + 5 = $
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 4$: 
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 5$:
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 9$:
    \end{parts}

  \end{multicols}

  \question Perhaps you now have a guess for a formula for the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers.  Before you write that down, how could we write the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers ``the long way''?  Last time, I asked you to compute the sum of the first 100 odd number: $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + 199$.  What should you replace 199 with to express the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers.
  \vfill
  \question Now write down your {\em conjecture}.  How confident are you that you are correct?  What could you do to become more confident?
  \vfill
  \question Become more confident!  In your group, decide on a way to convince a skeptical math student that your formula is correct.  This math student is so skeptical that just showing her that your formula works for a few more values of $n$ will have no effect.

\subsection*{Activity 2: Seeing dots}
The goal: investigate which numbers of dots can be arranged in which ways.

\begin{questions}
  \question Find a common way (perhaps in a particular shape) to arrange  the following numbers of dots: $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, and $25$.  (Your way should not work for 3 or 6 or 17 dots, for example.)  What is the next number of dots which can be arranged in this way?
  \vfill
  \question Earlier, you found that the number 16 can be expressed as $1 + 3 + 5 + 7$.  In the dot representation for 16 you gave above, locate collections of 1, 3, 5, and 7 dots.  Will something similar work for 25 dots?
  \vfill
  \question Find a common way to arrange the following numbers of dots: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21.  What is the next number of dots which can be arranged in this way?  What should we call these numbers?
  \vfill
  \question Notice that 16 can also be expressed as $6 + 10$.  Can you represent this fact using the dot arrangements from questions 1 and 3?  Do something similar for 25 dots.
  \vfill

\end{questions}

\subsection*{Activity 3: \textlangle insert witty title involving sums here\textrangle}
Our goal: Investigate the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n$.
\begin{questions}
  \question Find sums for small values of $n$.
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    $n = 1$:
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 2$: 
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 3$:
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 4$: 
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 5$:
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 6$:
    \vskip 1em
  \end{multicols}
  \question Let's call the sum of the first $n$ positive integers $T(n)$.  What does $T$ stand for?
  \vfill
  \question Find $T(100)$.
  \vfill
  \question Find a closed formula for $T(n)$.  How confident are you that you are correct?
  \vfill
  \vfill
  \vfill
  \question Find a formula for $T(n) + T(n+1)$.  (You might want to look back at activity 2, part 4.)
  \vfill
\end{questions}

\newpage

\subsection*{Activity 4: Triangles, Squares, and Cubes - oh my!}
Our goal: We have seen what happens when we add up odd numbers and positive integers.  What happens when we add up perfect cubes?

\begin{questions}
  \question Begin by gathering some data:
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    $1^3 =$
    \vskip 1em
    $1^3 + 2^3 =$
    \vskip 1em
    $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = $
    \vskip 1em
    $1^3 + 2 ^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = $
    \vskip 1.5em
    $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 =$
  \end{multicols}
  
  \vskip 2em
  \question Make a conjecture.
  \vfill
  \question What does your conjecture say the sum of the first 7 cubes should be?
  \vfill
  \question What is the sum of the first 7 cubes?  Did your conjecture work?
  \vfill
  \question How convinced are you that your conjecture is correct?  Can you think of an argument that would convince your skeptical friend?
  \vfill
  \vfill
\end{questions}
