\subsection*{Activity 1: Odds are\ldots awesome}
Our goal: find a nice formula for the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers.
\begin{questions}
  \question First, find the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers for small values of $n$.  Fill in the missing bits below:
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{parts} 
      \part $n = 1$: $1 = 1$
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 2$: $1 + 3 = \underline{\qquad}$
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 3$: $1 + 3 + 5 = \underline{\qquad}$
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 4$: \underline{\hspace{1.3in}} = \underline{\qquad}
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 5$: \underline{\hspace{1.5in}} = \underline{\qquad}
      \vskip 1em
      \part $n = 6$: \underline{\hspace{1.7in}} = \underline{\qquad}
    \end{parts}

  \end{multicols}

  \question Perhaps you now have a guess for a formula for the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers.  What is the sum of the first 10 odd numbers?  Check your answer.
  \vfill
  \question Now write down your {\em conjecture} (i.e., guess).  Write it both as an English sentence, and then also as an equation.  The equation will contain ``$+\cdots +$'' in it.
  \vfill
  \question Is your conjecture correct?  How do you know?  You don't need a complete answer to this, but spend 3 minutes thinking about your reasons for believing your conjecture.



\end{questions}

\subsection*{Activity 2: Seeing dots}
The goal: investigate which numbers of dots can be arranged in which ways.

\begin{questions}
  \question For each of the numbers below, arrange that many dots into a geometric shape.  The basic shape should be the same for all cases, and not work if I gave you 17 or 3 or 42 dots, for example.
\begin{center}
 \noindent 1 dot \qquad\qquad 4 dots \qquad\qquad\quad 9 dots \qquad\qquad\qquad 16 dots \qquad\qquad\qquad 25 dots  
  \end{center}

  \vfill
  \question Earlier, you found that the number 16 can be expressed as $1 + 3 + 5 + 7$.  In the dot representation for 16 you gave above, locate collections of 1, 3, 5, and 7 dots.  Can you do so in such a way that can be extended to 25 dots?
  \vfill
  \question Find a common way to arrange the numbers of dots below.  What is the next number of dots which can be arranged in this way?  What should we call these numbers?
  \begin{center}
 \noindent 1 dot \qquad\qquad 3 dots \qquad\qquad\quad 6 dots \qquad\qquad\qquad 10 dots \qquad\qquad\qquad 15 dots  
  \end{center}

  \vfill
  \question Notice that 16 can also be expressed as $6 + 10$.  Can you represent this fact using the dot arrangements from questions 1 and 3?  Do something similar for 25 dots.
  \vfill

\end{questions}

\newpage
\subsection*{Activity 3: \textlangle insert witty title involving sums here\textrangle}
Our goal: Investigate the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n$.
\begin{questions}
  \question Find sums for small values of $n$.
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    $n = 1$:
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 2$: 
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 3$:
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 4$: 
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 5$:
    \vskip 1em
    $n = 6$:
    \vskip 1em
  \end{multicols}
  \question Let's call the sum of the first $n$ positive integers $T(n)$ (what does $T$ stand for?).  Find $T(100)$.
  \vfill
  \question Find a closed formula for $T(n)$.  Check that it works with a few examples.
  \vfill
  \vfill
  \vfill
  \question Find a formula for $T(n) + T(n+1)$.  (You might want to look back at activity 2, part 4.)
  \vfill
\end{questions}

\newpage

\subsection*{Activity 4: Triangles, Squares, and Cubes - oh my!}
Our goal: We have seen what happens when we add up odd numbers and positive integers.  What happens when we add up perfect cubes?

\begin{questions}
  \question Begin by gathering some data:
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    $1^3 =$
    \vskip 1em
    $1^3 + 2^3 =$
    \vskip 1em
    $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = $
    \vskip 1em
    $1^3 + 2 ^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = $
    \vskip 1.5em
    $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 =$
  \end{multicols}
  
  \vskip 2em
  \question Make a conjecture.  Again, write your conjecture both as an English sentence and an equation.
  \vfill
  \question What does your conjecture say the sum of the first 7 cubes should be?
  \vfill
  \question What is the sum of the first 7 cubes?  Did your conjecture work?
  \vfill
  \question How convinced are you that your conjecture is correct?  Can you think of an argument that would convince a skeptical friend?
  \vfill
\end{questions}
